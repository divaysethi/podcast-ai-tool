 You've heard the whispers haven't you? The allure of financial markets, the promise of swift gains, and well, let's be honest, sometimes the sting of losses too. But what if there was a way to navigate the exciting yet incredibly volatile world of forex trading with a, well, a unique blend of strategy and maybe some ironclad discipline. It's a common dream for many, yeah. But, you know, very few achieve consistent success without a really deeply thought out system. So today we're taking a deep dive into the insights of Sunel Kuchal or SK, as he's often known. He's a chartered accountant with over two decades of experience. Wow, 20 years. Yeah. And he didn't just sort of wander into forex. He meticulously built his own distinct approach. He was aiming for consistent double digit annual returns, you know, for financial independence. That's a goal, isn't it financial independence? Exactly. So our mission today is really to unpack some of the key ideas from chapter 15 of SK's book, a practical system for trading forex. That's a great book. It is. And we're also bringing in some psychological insights from Mark Douglas's classic trading in the zone. Oh, yeah, essential reading. Absolutely. So we're going to explore how forex rewards are really fundamentally different from equities. Why your wins must outweigh your risks. For sure. Point. The power of capital turnover. And really importantly, how to conquer that mental game. The one that trips up even, you know, the sharpest traders out there. It's really about reshaping your whole perspective, isn't it? On how markets work and maybe more importantly, how you interact with them. Yeah. Exactly. So let's start there. What's one of the biggest misconceptions people bring over from, say, stock investing into forex? It's that buy and hold idea. Oh, definitely. That buy and hold fallacy. People think, Oh, long term works like it doesn't equities. Yeah, sit on it. And that for forex is just a huge mistake. A really big mistake. Why is that? Well, unlike equities, where you're buying a piece of a company that could theoretically grow forever, you know, no trend in forex last forever, currencies move in cycles. They're influenced by global economics, politics, just the ebb and flow of capital. So much going on. It is the very nature of forex trading. It demands active management. You can't just buy, say, your dollar and hope it goes up forever, like you might with a tech stock. Right. The market forces are just their immense and constantly shifting. So if buy and hold is out, how does Sunile say we actually make money consistently in forex? Right. So SK's core principle here is vital. You must keep turning over your capital, turning over capital. Yeah. It's not about chasing these huge risky moves on one single trade. It's about consistently making small, what do you call bite sized wins? Bite sized wins. I like that. Yeah, maybe 1% to 2% every couple of weeks, writing each medium term trend. Okay. So you're not waiting years for one big payoff. You're like compounding smaller, more frequent returns. Exactly. Exactly. Right. So now points out that just 1% per week done consistently and consistency is absolutely the keyword here. That alone will generate a, well, a staggering 52% annual return. And that's assuming no losses, which isn't realistic, but it shows the power. Wow. 52%. That's huge compared to most equity returns. It is if far outstrips most traditional equity classes. So it's about accumulating those small frequent wins, rather than betting everything on one massive long term gain that might, you know, might never happen. Like the bakery analogy you mentioned earlier. Yeah. I think that fits well. Small profit per loaf, but sell hundreds daily. Turn over the capital quickly. That's the mindset SK advocates for forex. Okay. That makes sense. And that leads us directly to Sunni's, well, cornerstone for success, right? Balancing risk and reward. He uses that quote from Monash Pabre. Yes. Heads you in, tails you don't lose much brilliant line. It really sums it up, doesn't it? It's the bedrock. The absolute bedrock of sound risk management means your system, your whole approach has to be structured so your average win portrayed is bigger than your average loss. Bigger by how much? Well, Sunni is specific. He recommends your average win should be at least twice your average loss. Twice. Okay. Yeah. And that's not just some random number. It's critical for long term profitability and frankly for survival in the market. Yeah. You could win say 70% of your trades. What sounds great? It does. But if those are 30% losses are huge, they can just wipe out all the wins. And then some, you'll bleed your account dry. Right. So the size of the wins versus the size of the losses is completely critical and tied right into that is position sizing. Yeah. The 2% rule. Exactly. SK's golden rule risks no more than 2% of your account equity on any single trade. Now, some people might hear 2% and think, wow, that's really low. That's too conservative. What's the thinking there? Well, that 2% is an arbitrary either. It's really about longevity. Think about it. A 10% loss on your account. You need an 11.1% gain just to get back to even. Okay. Yeah. But a 2% loss. You only need about a 2.04% gain to recover. It keeps the damage small, manageable. Psychologically manageable too. I imagine. hugely important. It protects your psychological capital. It lets you take a loss, learn from it, and move on without that emotional paralysis or the urge for revenge trading. It keeps you in the game. It's really a strategic defense. Okay. That makes a lot of sense. And then there's leverage. The big one in 4x. It feels like a double-edged sword. It absolutely is. Leverage is what makes 4x potentially so profitable, right? Yeah. It lets you control positions much larger than your actual account balance. Which sounds amazing. It does. But as SK warns, leverage can be just as devastating if you don't have a solid strategy. And crucially, the discipline to stick to it. Right. He compares it to gasoline. Gasoline. Okay. Yeah. Incredibly powerful, but also incredibly dangerous if you myth use it. Yeah. That's a good analogy. So his rule of thumb is basically never exceed leverage of more than say 25 times or maybe 30 times your capital at any point. Okay. Keep a lid on it. Exactly. It gives you enough power to make meaningful trades. But without putting your entire account at massive risk from one bad move, it gives you room to breathe and absorb those small, acceptable losses. That discipline approach to leverage really sets the stage, doesn't it? Because it sounds like, for Sadeil, consistently profitable trading boils down to understanding the cold, hard math of your strategy. This idea he calls expectancy. That's right. Expectancy. It's a way to quantify the long term profitability of any trading system has a calculated. The basic formula is expectancy equals your win loss ratio multiplied by your win rate. Okay. Win rate and win loss ratio define those. Sure. Win rate is simple. Number of winning trades divided by the number of losing trades. Got it. And the win loss ratio is your average dollar win per trade divided by your average dollar loss per trade. You want a positive expectancy overall. That's the goal. So Nail's examples really make this clear. Like even if your average win is the same as your average loss, a one to one ratio. Right. You can still be profitable if you just win more often than you lose. Say, win 10, lose 5. Your expectancy is positive. Correct. But now imagine you double your average win compared to your average loss. So a two to one ratio. Like the rule you mentioned earlier. Exactly. Now, even if your win rate is lower, say you only win 10 and lose 3. Your profitability to skyrockets because those wins are much bigger than the losses. The expectancy shoots up in the flip side. The flip side is dangerous. Even if you win more trades than you lose, say, win 6, lease 3. If your average loss is huge, maybe a thousand dollar loss versus a four hundred dollar win. Ouch. Yeah. You're still losing money overall. Your expectancy is negative. You're digging yourself into a hole despite winning more often. It's like that casino analogy as K uses. It's perfect. The casino doesn't win every hand. But they win more bets than they lose and critically their wins on average are structured to be bigger than their losses over time. Their edge, their positive expectancy. Your trading needs that same mathematical edge. So we've got the strategy, the math. But then there's the big one. The invisible opponent, our own sec holiday. I know the human element. Yeah. Hescan, Mark Douglas both say this is why most traders fail. Right. Even with a decent system, we get caught between these two big fears. That's it. The fear of being wrong. Yeah. Which stops us from cutting our losses quickly. Running losers run. Exactly. And then the fear of being right, which makes us jump out of winning trades way too soon. Cutting winner short, the classic mistakes. They are. And Mark Douglas in trading in the zone, he really digs into why this happens. He says the trader's mindset, thinking purely in probabilities is just very foreign to how we normally think. How so? Well, in daily life, we look for certainty. Right. We want to know what's going to happen. But the market. It offers zero certainty. It's just a stream of probabilities. This rate has a 60% chance of working. That one 40%. Nothing is guaranteed. And trying to find certainty where there isn't any that causes problems. Huge problems. Douglas calls it the illusion. The second you decide or worse, assume you know what the market will do next. You expect to be right. You automatically expect to be right. And that expectation, that illusion of certainty, it leads directly to all those classic trading errors, hesitating, jumping the gun, not taking a predefined loss, because you sure will turn around or bailing on a winner too early because you're scared to lose the profit or even letting a good winner turn into a loser because you were certain ahead for the to go. You stop trading the market and start trading your own beliefs about the market. So how do we fight that? How do we develop that? Traders mindset. Well, Douglas suggests it starts with building real self trust. And that comes from one thing. Stopping the errors. Simple as that. Simple concept. Hard in practice. But when you consistently follow your rules, when you stop making those unforced errors, you naturally start trusting yourself more. And as that self-trust grows, so does yourself confidence. And that allows you to execute your edge, your proven strategy without hesitation or fear. You just act. So the ultimate goal is what? To just accept the risk. To genuinely accept the risk fully on an emotional level, knowing that any single trade could lose, but your edge will play out over many trades. That acceptance leads to what Douglas calls a carefree objective state of mind. Carefree. Trading doesn't seem carefree. Huh. Means free from the care of needing any one trade to work out. You're detached from the outcome of a single event because you trust the process. You see what the market is offering from its perspective, not through your own hopes or fears. Okay, that's a powerful idea. Now, Sunil offers some practical tools to help us manage this inner game, doesn't he? He talks about the trading diary. Yes, your first friend, he calls it. And it's not just a log of trades. Win loss. What makes it different? It's a detailed record of your mistakes. Specifically, when you deviate from your own rules, why did you take that trade? Why did you exit there? Why didn't you take the loss sooner? It helps you really understand your trading personality. Your personal trading demons, so to speak. Exactly. Are you prone to revenge trading? Do you chase breakouts? Do you freeze up? You need to know your patterns. And review it often. Oh, absolutely. As Kay says, review it often, at least weekly. And always write down a conclusion, a key takeaway from each mistake or deviation. It's like watching your own game tape in sports. You analyze, learn, and train yourself to do better next time. Game tape for traders. I like it. And the second friend, the risk management dashboard. Yes, equally critical. And this is way more than just a spreadsheet. Okay. Think of it as a control center for everything you're doing in the market. It should pull in real time prices, track your open positions, calculate potential risk on new trades based on your rules, and even help identify the current trend according to your system. So it keeps everything objective. Precisely. SK is adamant. Yep. If you skip building and using something like this, you likely won't improve. It provides that clear, unbiased picture. It gives you the cold, hard data to counteract your emotional impulses and stick to your plan. Makes sense. So connecting all this back to the actual tools that indicators Sunal uses. He's clear that one indicator isn't a system right? Absolutely not. He stresses that a single indicator, like just using RSI or MCD on its own, isn't a trading system. A system is a collection of tools, indicators, and rules working together like parts of a car. And these tools primarily help manage risk. Yes, risk management is their main job in his system. And by helping manage risk objectively, they naturally support stronger trading psychology because they reduce the guesswork and the emotional decision making. Okay. So which indicators does he highlight for this? Well, he uses several from each mocus system and others. For risk management, for instance, he finds dodgy and channels very useful. Dodgy channels. Yeah, they basically plot the highest tie and lowest low over a set period. SK finds the 13 hour dodgy channel is particularly good for setting tighter trailing stops and minimizing risk as a trade progresses. It gives you a clear visual boundary. Okay. And what about parabolic SAR? Ah, SAR. It's great for pinpointing potential entry and exit points and especially for trailing profits. Yeah. You see those dots flipping above or below the price. Yeah. That can signal a potential shift. But and this is a big but from SK. Yeah. It should never be used as a standalone indicator. Why not? It's just too sensitive to choppy markets to volatility. It can give a lot of false signals if you rely on it alone. It needs confirmation from other parts of the system. Like a very sensitive compass. Good for fine tuning, but not for navigating the whole journey by itself. Got it. Needs backup. Then there are components from the itchamoku system. Chakuspan and Kajunsen. Yes. The Chakuspan, lagging span and the Kajunsen baseline or Kijunsen, as he calls it. These are considered stronger, more reliable trend indicators within that system. And he uses the case in his trading line. You mentioned the 216 period case in specifically for weekly trading. That's right. SK often incorporates that specific to their since 16 period Kajunsen into his trading line concept, especially for looking at weekly charts. Why 216 period seems very specific. It is. That longer setting helps filter out a lot of the short-term market noise on a weekly chart. It gives a much clearer, more objective view of the underlying medium to longer term trend, which is crucial for the kind of trading he does. It helps distinguish real shifts from just minor bumps, seeing the forest, not just the trees. And this trading line concept itself? It's like a personalized guide. Sort of, yeah. It's a concept he uses to combine elements like the case in to create a dynamic reference line on the chart. It helps guide decisions on taking trades where to place initial stops, how to trail stops, and when to consider booking profits. All based on the system's rules. It's about managing risk systematically. And all of this feeds back into that risk management dashboard. Ideally, yes. The dashboard integrates the signals or levels from these key indicators to provide that comprehensive objective view. It helps ensure you're making decisions based on the system, not just a gut feeling or fear or greed. It's about discipline through process. So wrapping this all up, what does this deep dive mean for you, the listener? We've explored how Forex trading. Well, it's a different beast from equity investing. Totally different mindset required. It thrives on that consistent capital turnover, those bite-sized wins, and really precise risk management. We've seen how understanding expectancy, the math behind your wins and losses, can totally transform your approach. Knowing your numbers is key. And maybe most importantly, we've seen how mastering your own psychology using practical tools like that detailed trading diary and a solid risk dashboard is just paramount. It really is. It's a journey of self-mastery just as much as market mastery. You can have the best strategy, but if the inner game isn't right, it can all fall apart. So true. So here's the final provocative thought for you to chew on. If the path the consistent success in trading really lies in thinking and probabilities and genuinely accepting risk to reach that carefree objective state of mind. How might applying that very same mindset change your approach to opportunities, to risks, to challenges in maybe every other part of your life? That's a deep question. Because those principles, they really do transcend trading, don't they? They can reshape how you deal with uncertainty pretty much everywhere. Absolutely. Now, the principles we've touched on today, especially from chapter 15, they're really just the beginning of Sunil's system. Just scratching the surface. For the full picture, the detailed strategies, the specific indicator setups, the examples that build on everything we've discussed, we definitely recommend checking out Sunil Kruchol's book of practical system for trading forex. Yeah, if this resonates with you, the book lays it all out step by step.
