 I wish you could just cut through all the jargon and quickly get the essentials of something complex like Forex trading. Yeah, it can feel pretty overwhelming sometimes. Okay, let's dive straight in then because in this deep dive that's exactly what we're doing. We're pulling out the key bits from Suniel Pechelle's book, A Practical System for Trading Forex. Right. Try to give you a real feel for his experience-based approach. He's got 22 years in Forex plus that solid background as a chartered accountant, MBA, and finance, international banking too. So he's definitely seen a few things. We're focusing today on, well, what makes Forex potentially profitable according to him, how he actually looks at trends. And his rules for managing risk, super important, plus the structure of the Forex market itself, which is kind of unique. And his methods for trend following all distilled from his experience. Think of it as a shortcut, maybe, getting the core ideas without needing to read hundreds of pages first. Exactly. And his whole journey into Forex started with something pretty relatable, what he calls an expensive lesson. With a multi-currency home loan back in Australia, currency fluctuations hit him hard, apparently. Ah, okay. So it was personal finance paying that pushed him to really understand it. Not just academic interest. Right. Which I think makes his perspective quite grounded, you know? Definitely. It makes you think, doesn't it? How often are our own sort of financial bumps spark a deeper dive into how things work? So let's get to the big question. Profitability. Kuchel talks about aiming for double-digit annual returns with his system. Yeah. And achieving that even during crazy times like the COVID-19 pandemic volatility, which is pretty impressive. It really is. And his goal wasn't just profit for profit's sake, was it? No, it was more about financial independence, but, crucially, with minimal daily effort. He designed it specifically for like the working professional, someone with day job. Okay, that's a key distinction. Now, one huge factor in Forex profit potential is leverage. Maybe we should quickly explain that. Good idea. So leverage basically means you're borrowing funds from your broker. It lets you control a much bigger position in the market than your own capital would allow on its own. You see these ratios offered like 20X, sometimes even way higher, like 100X. Exactly. And that amplification is what creates the potential for significant returns. Kuchel gives an example. I think you mentioned a potential 3% daily return with just 10X leverage. Yeah. And when you think about that compounding over a year, the potential numbers get pretty staggered. They do. But, and this is the massive. And that's both ways, right? Absolutely. Leverage magnifies losses just as fast as it magnifies gains. It's a classic double-edged sword. Kuchel's got a rule for this, doesn't he? He does. A really important one. Resist the temptation to go over 30X leverage, even if your broker lets you. So discipline right from the start, that risk side is crucial. Critical, because it ties into this other concept you discusses for long term profitability. Expectancy. Okay, what does that mean in practice? He defines it as win loss ratio times win rate, I think. Sort of, yeah. It's basically a measure of whether your training system is likely to make money over the long haul. The core idea is that your average win has to be bigger than your average loss. Makes sense. You need the winners to pay for the losers and then some. Exactly. Ideally, he suggests aiming for your average win to be at least twice the size of your average loss. Right. And he also mentions a simpler target. Aiming for just a 1% learn per week. Which might not sound huge initially, but consistency is key. That 1% compound significantly over time. It's about the long game, not hitting home runs every trade. Precisely. It really makes you pause and think, when you look at any investment, how do you personally weigh that potential reward against the risk involved? Okay, let's shift gears to trends. You always hear that phrase, the trend is your friend, but what does Google actually mean by trend? Well he argues it's more than just drawing some random lines on a chart, defining and measuring trends properly is key. And he has a really unique way of looking at trend duration, doesn't he? Using prime numbers. Yeah, that's quite distinctive. He talks about two day, three day, five day trends, and even really specific ones like 13 hours or 41 days. Why prime numbers? Is there a logic behind that? He believes they help filter out market noise and identify more fundamental rhythms. It's a way to look past the short term, Chitter. And his method for spotting the trend is very direct. How so? Just comparing the current price to the price from that specific period ago. So for a, say, 27 hour trend, you just look, is the price now higher or lower than it was 27 hours back? Simple enough. And this ties into the Icha Moku system he uses, specifically something called the Chiku Span or Slin. Exactly. The Chiku Span is brilliant for this. He plots the current price, but shifted back in time on the chart, usually 26 periods by default, though we often tweak that. So it lets you visually compare now versus then? Precisely. You can immediately see if the current price is above or below or the price was in the past. He really relies on the Chiku Span. Actually, he recommends not using settings below 27 periods. Okay. So it's like a built-in visual confirmation lag? Kind of, yeah. It confirms if current strength or weakness is supported by recent history. But he's careful to distinguish the actual trend, the price direction over time. From a trend line. Right. The trend line is more of a tool, a proxy, right? Useful for guidance for setting stops maybe, but not the trend itself in his view. Got it. Let's talk about the market itself now. Forex is structured very differently from, say, the stock market, isn't it? Completely. It's decentralized. There's no single physical building like the New York Stock Exchange. It's all over the counter or OTC. Trading happens through this global network of banks, institutions, broker. He mentions the ECN, the exchange currency network. What's that role? Think of the ECN as the core network where the big players, the banks, the major institutions trade directly with each other. It's like the wholesale market. Okay. And retail traders like us. We access it through Forex brokers. They connect to the ECNs, giving us a gateway to that liquidity. So you're tapping into this vast global network via your broker. Right. So it's a central spot, but a massive network. And it runs pretty much nonstop during the week. Yeah. 24 hours a day, five days a week. It kicks off in Australia on Monday morning, follows the sun, wraps up in the US on Friday afternoon, which means opportunities can pop up almost any time. This year's size of it is also mind boggling. He quotes figures like $7.5 trillion daily volume. $7.5 trillion a day in 2022, according to the bank for international settlements, it just dwarfs stock exchanges. Absolutely dwarfs them. He compares it to the NYSE, which might do what, $19 billion, a tiny fraction. And this huge volume, this liquidity has big implications. Definitely. He calls Forex close to a perfect market. Meaning it's incredibly difficult for any single entity to push prices around for long. There are just too many participants, too much money flowing. It makes it very efficient. And that liquidity is precisely why trend following strategies can work well in Forex. He uses the analogy of a giant ocean liner. It takes a lot of sustained force to turn it. Trends in a market this deep tend to be more robust, less easily disrupted than in thinner markets. It makes sense. He also points out the US dollar's dominance involved in like 90% of trades and lists the majors, but he focuses mostly on one pair himself. Yeah, the IUUSD, the Aussie dollar versus the US dollar. And this is important to you conscience that the specific settings and techniques in his book, they're primarily tested and optimized for that pair. So if you wanted to trade say Euro dollar using his system, you'd need to adapt and test it carefully yourself. Exactly. What works perfectly for one pair might not work as well for another without adjustments. Now just quickly, when you trade a pair like IUUSD, what are you actually doing? You're always doing two things at once. Buying one currency and selling the other. So if you buy IUUSD, you're buying Aussie dollars and selling US dollars. Betting the Aussie will strengthen against the greenback. And the profit or loss comes from how that exchange rate moves measured in tiny increments called Pips. Right. Usually the fourth decimal place, small moves, but with leverage, they can add up fast for good or bad. Understanding this basic plumbing of the market is step one, really. It makes you think, were you really aware of just how different and massive forex is compared to stocks? That's definitely a different beast. Okay, let's move on to maybe the most vital topic, risk management. Ah, yes. Crucial. He quotes Larry Williams. Profits we can all handle it is the losses that will kill us. That says it all, really. It really does. So what are the core parts of risk management and kuchal system? He boils it down to three main things. First, how much of your equity, your capital, you risk on any single trade. Second, where you set your stop loss. And third, the timing of your entry. He talks about stop losses and challenges the idea that tighter stops always mean lower risk. What's his take? His point is that super tight stops might seem safer because the loss on any single trade is small, but you're much more likely to get knocked out of a potentially good trade just by normal market noise, the random fluctuations. So you get stopped out, even if the main trend is still going your way. Exactly. He actually prefers setting somewhat looser stops, placing them at price levels that are less likely to be hit by just short term volatility, giving the trade more room to breathe. Interesting. Giving the trend a chance to prove itself, but he still sticks to that classic rule. Never risk more than 2% of your capital on one trade idea. Absolutely. Not negotiable, but he adds a wrinkle. If you enter a trade and it initially moves against you slightly, he suggests you might consider adding to the position at a better price. If your overall risk across all entries stays within that original 2% limit. And critically, you don't move your initial stop loss level. So kind of averaging in, but with a strict overall risk cap. Precisely. It needs serious discipline. And that third element, timing, is also key for risk. What does he mean there? Basically, wait for confirmation. Don't just jump in because you think a correction is over. Wait for the price to actually start moving in your intended direction again before committing. Patients reduces risk. He also mentions using a risk management dashboard. Like a spreadsheet. Yeah. Some kind of tool, probably a Google sheet he mentions, to systematically track your trades, your open risk, everything, keeping it objective. And alongside that, he's a big advocate for a trading diary. Huge advocate. And not just logging P&L. He means really digging into why you took a trade, what mistakes you made, what you learned, win or lose. Like a performance review for yourself. Exactly. But reviewing it regularly is how you understand your own trading personality, spot bad habits, and stop repeating errors. It's about learning from experience in a structured way. And those two core rules, again, max 2% risk per idea, max 30X leverage overall. Those are the guard rails. Absolutely. They're designed to keep you in the game long enough for your edge, your positive expectancy to play out. Makes you think, how often do you really analyze your own financial decisions afterwards to learn from them? Good question. Okay. So, you're following this is in control to his whole approach, right? He uses analogies like following a guide car or water skiing behind a speedboat. Great visuals. They really are. What's the core idea? Identify a clear trend, get in line with it and follow it. But at a safe distance. Not too close to get shaken off by bumps, but not so far back, you miss the ride. Exactly. And in his Ichimoku context, that safe distance often relates back to that Chikos ban, looking back about 27 periods. Okay. Chikos ban helps define that safe following distance. He mentions using the 30 minute chart primarily. Yeah, the M30. Which means if you're using a 27 period look back on the Chiku, your minimum sort of safe distance view is looking back about 13 and a half hours. And if you see different trends on different time frames like a short term dip, but a long term rise. Always treated with a bigger trend. That's his rule. If the two day trend is up, you look for buys. Even if the 13.5 hour chart shows the temporary pullback. He'll try out the noise, follow the main current. He suggests always having at least two trend durations visible. Yeah, for that context, you need the bigger picture. He also uses other Ichimoku parts for confirmation, like the baseline, the Kijunsen and the cloud itself. Getting signals from multiple independent parts of the system builds confidence. Right. And he briefly mentions shifting a trend line, displaced moving averages. Yeah, DMAs. That's about shifting a moving average forward or backward on the chart to try and get it to line up better with future price or key past levels. It can help spot potential turning points or support resistance. And he has a specific technique with that. He mentions shifting a long term EMA, an exponential moving average, and then looking for trades when price interacts with that shifted line, specifically at the Chukikus band's position. It essentially doubles the lag, aiming for really solid, confirmed signals. Okay. So more lag, but higher confidence maybe. And he uses the Kijunsen, the baseline, often with a long period like 216, maybe with ATR bands, as his main line for actually riding the trend. Seems that way, yes. Using the Kijunsen 216 with average true range bands to gauge volatility around that core trend line, it's all about finding a robust trend and sticking with it, using the systems tools for entry, management, and exit signals. Okay. So wrapping up this deep dive into Sunil Kuchal's a practical system for trading 4X. We've covered quite a bit. His focus on profitability through consistency and careful leverage. His unique time-based approach to defining and measuring trends using primes and the Ichimoku system. The absolute critical nature of risk management, the 2% rule, the stop loss philosophy, the trading diary, understanding the 4X market structure, decentralized, massive liquidity, why that matters for trends. And finally, the core principles of trend following the safe distance, aligning with the bigger trend using confirmation. It really stands out as how interconnected it all is, isn't it? Profitability doesn't happen in a vacuum. It depends on understanding trends, managing risk effectively, all within the context of how the specific market behaves. Definitely feels like a very holistic, practical system built from years on the ground. So for you listening in, thinking about all this, what parts of Kuchal's approach jumped out at you? Yeah, what resonates is that the specific indicators like the Tchiku span, the idea of prime number durations, maybe the risk management rules, or perhaps as emphasis on the trading diary and self-reflection. Could be any of those. The core message seems to be about discipline and having a systematic framework, rather than just reacting. For sure, building a defined process. Well, this is given us a really good overview of foundation. To really get it, you'd obviously need to dig deeper into those specific tools and techniques he outlines. Absolutely. Maybe we can tackle some of those more advanced concepts from the book in future deep dives. Now, thanks for joining us for this look into a practical approach to Forex.
