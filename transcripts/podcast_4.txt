 Welcome curious minds to another deep dive. Our mission here is always the same. Cut through the noise, find those nuggets of knowledge, especially in financial trade. Exactly. And today we're looking at a really interesting tool. Yeah, today we're plunging into something powerful, maybe a bit less known. Doncian channels. That's right. There are tons of indicators out there, but these Doncian channels, they offer a really unique way to look at the market. How so? Well, they help you grasp market dynamics, spot trends, and, this is crucial, manage risk really precisely, maybe more so than some other tools. Okay, so our deep dive today is all about unpacking these channels. We'll get into their pretty fascinating origins, right? Yes, similarly. And then see how a seasoned trader, like Sunil Kuchil, SK will call them, uses them now, for 4X. We'll dig into the concepts behind them, how they link up with trends, swing structures. And most importantly, how you can potentially use them. For that precise risk management, short-term trading, we'll look at that 13 hour trend specifically. Yeah, and even touch on how other indicators can, you know, confirm the signals, it's about building a picture. All right, ready to dive in? Absolutely. So to really get these channels, we need to rewind a bit. Back to the 1950s. Okay. And meet a real legend in commodities trading, Richard Duncan. He's the guy who invented them. Richard Duncan. And his story's remarkable, you said. It really is, because, you know, most people back then, and maybe even now, think trading is just some kind of art. You're either born with it or you're not. Right, and then Nate Talant sort of thing. Exactly. But Duncan, he completely challenged that idea. He was successful, sure. But he believed trading wasn't some mystery. He thought it could be systematized, taught to anyone. That was his belief. And he set out to prove it with this pretty famous experiment. Okay. I'm intrigued. What kind of experiment? He literally took a group of total beginners tradesmen, like carpenters, painters, people with zero trading background. Wow. And he set out to teach them how to trade successfully using a system he developed. And the core of that system, the donkey and channels. So the indicator came out of his need to teach novices systematically. Pretty much. His original system was incredibly simple, really mechanical. You'd buy if the price broke above the highest high of the last 20 days. Just like that, a simple rule. Yep. And conversely, if it dropped below the lowest low of the last 20 days, you'd get out, or maybe even go short. No gut feelings, no reading the tea leaves, just rules. Exactly, purely mechanical. Which, back then, really went against the grain, you know. And these trainees became quite famous, didn't they? The turtle traders. That's them. The turtle traders, their results were impressive. And it kind of sent shockwaves. It solid proof that, yeah, maybe trading could be taught if you had a discipline systematic approach. It's amazing how a concept from the 50s is still so relevant. So how does this basic idea translate to today's, you know, much faster 4x markets? This brings us to SK's work. Right. Okay, the author we're drawing from, he considers the Don Chien channel specifically, the 13 hour Don Chien channel to be the, and this is his word cornerstone of his scalping strategy. Cornerstone, that's a strong word. But why 13 hours? That seems very specific, not 10, not 20. It does sound specific, doesn't it? SK explains it has links to the Fibonacci sequence and prime numbers. Concepts he explores earlier in his book, these sort of natural market rhythms. Okay. The practical reason for scalping, he says, is that the 13 hour channel essentially captures every trend smaller than 13 hours. Ah, so for those quick and in out trades, it keeps you aligned with the very immediate market pulse. Precisely. You're right there with the short term rhythm. Which immediately makes me think about risk. Scalping feels like it needs really tight risk control. You're absolutely right. And that's where SK says 13 hour Don Chien really shines. He calls it the best trend line to control our risk. The best one. Okay. He makes a pre-bold claim that treating with it can safely generate 1% return on the account each time, which highlights how central it is to both his risk management and his profit goals. A 1% return each time with safety. That's the dream for many traders, I imagine. What's the underlying market behavior that makes this 13 hour channel so good at finding these spots? Okay. So to get that, we need to talk about price compression and expansion. It's fundamental market stuff. Now SK uses this vivid analogy stepping on a landmine. Imagine pressure building up. That's compression. The price gets squeezed. Okay. Like winding a spring. Yeah, exactly. Then boom, it explodes. That's the expansion, the breakout. And this happens both ways. Pressure builds near support. Price explodes up. Pressure builds near resistance. Price breaks down. The market releasing tension. Got it. And he has another analogy, the jackknife dive. Yeah. The forward pike dive or jackknife. It's brilliant for visualizing turning points. Picture a diver jumping at the very peak of their jump. They curl up tight, right? Position three. In that moment, the distance head to toe that's like the donchi and channel range is smallest. Ah, the channel narrows. Exactly. And there are momentum. It's basically zero. They're suspended just about to reverse direction and dive down. So that curled the position on a chart. That's the sweet spot. For a bigger trend, maybe like a daily 27 hour trend, he mentions is losing steam, narrowing its range, ready to turn. That's precisely it. And that point often lines up with the 13 hour mark, which is roughly half of that 27 hour daily cycle. It represents the point of theoretically the least risk for a trade entry. Because momentum is lowest, the range is tightest. Right. It helps pinpoint those moments where the market might pivot with less initial force against you. So key for risk management in his view. That means a really clear picture. So think about trends and swings. SK says donchi and channels are actually superior to moving averages. Why? It's fair question. Moving averages smooth out closing prices, right? So they can lag behind what's actually happening. Donchi and channels though, they track the absolute highest high and lowest low over the period, the extremes. So they capture the full volatility, the actual range. Exactly. Not just an average. It gives you a clearer, more immediate boundary of price action. And this helps define market swings much more distinctly. And how does the 13 hour structure specifically relate to those swings? Well, SK connects a 13 hour break out to something he calls a three bar swing on a four hour chart, the H4. A three bar swing. What does that look like? Think of it like this. Maybe a six hour trend up, then one distinct bar where it turns around a U turn bar and then a six hour trend down, like a mini peak. Okay. A small cycle. A three bar pattern. He says it can give you advanced notice of a five day trend reversal. Wow. That early. Yeah. The idea is if a bigger daily trend is going to turn, the 13 hour structure that shorter term pulse will likely be the first thing to break. It's your early warning signal. That's incredibly valuable. So based on that, I assume the advice is pretty clear. Don't fight that 13 hour trend. Absolutely. Crystal clear SK emphasizes. Stay with the 13 three trend and never trade against it even for short term scalping. It's fundamental. Keeps you flowing with the immediate momentum. Right. Reduces getting chopped up by noise. Okay. Let's give practical. How do traders actually use these breakouts for risk management and for that short term scalping we talked about? So the channels give you objective entry and exit points. Price breaks above the upper channel. That's a potential long entry signal. Okay. So the lower the lower channel potential short signal or maybe time to exit your long pretty straightforward. But the risk management part is where the 13 hour channel really comes in. That's the key. For a long trade, your stop loss goes right at the 13 hour don't you in low. For a short, it's right at the 13 hour don't you in high. So defines your risk very clearly from the outset. Exactly. It gives the trend a bit of room, but your maximum potential loss is strictly defined by that recent low or high. Very disciplined. Scalping that 13 hour breakout is the main opportunity generator aiming for that 1%. That's what SK suggests. Yes. He sees that 13 hour breakout as the prime spot for scalping, often aiming to capture that 1% profit potentially within say a 24 hour period. And what about even faster charts like 5 minute 15 minute? He mentions those two, but stress is that any scalping on those super short time frames must always respect the risk parameters set by the larger two day trading line. Ah, so keeping the bigger picture in mind, even for tiny traits. Right. It's about nested time frames, making sure your micro actions align with the controlled macro view discipline across the board. Makes sense. So donkey channels are powerful, but SK is clear. One indicator is in a whole system union confirmation, right? Absolutely. That's a core part of his philosophy. A real trading system is a collection of tools working together confirming each other. I can orchestra as you said earlier. Exactly. And interestingly, he points out a direct link between donkey and channels and another popular system, each moku. Oh, really? How do they connect? The midpoint of the donkey and channel range, halfway between the high and the low, is actually the same calculation as the kitchens and or case in line in each moku. No kidding. So they share DNA essentially. In a way, yes. It shows how these different tools can sometimes measure similar underlying market structures. So how do other each moku elements like the cloud or the Chiku span help confirm Donchine signals? They add layers of context. The Chiku span, for example, plots the current price back in time. If it's clearly above past prices, it confirms upward momentum. The cloud itself shifts color and position, giving you a visual forecast of potential support in resistance zones and trend direction. So each moku provides a broader environmental check for the Donchine signal. That's a good way to put it. It adds conviction. What about oscillators? Things like Williams-Persar? Where do they fit? Oscillators are great for spotting short term extremes within the main trend. They measure overbought or oversold conditions. It's a not trend direction, but the ebbs and flows within the trend. Precisely. They help identify potential dips in an uptrend to buy or rallies in a downtrend to sell short. SK mentions using Williams-Persar with a 13 setting, tying it back to that key 13 hour time frame. Signing your entry within the established 13 hour trend using the oscillator. That's the idea. It helps refine the entry point. So the big rule is, confirmation is king. Never use one tool alone. Absolutely. SK is very explicit. Never use the Man-C-D in isolation, for example. Always pair an oscillator with a trend indicator like Donkian. And critically, only trade in the direction the trend indicator is pointing. Stick with the main flow. Right. It's notes that something like the parabolic SAR often gives very similar signals to the Donkian channel, which acts as another layer of confirmation. It's about building a consensus among your tools. Like building a case before you act. Exactly like that. Well, this has been a fascinating deep dive into Donkian channels. We started with Richard Donkian, the turtle traders. Yeah. Quite a story there. Yeah, the origins are pretty cool. And then saw how SK makes the 13 hour Donkian the absolute cornerstone of his 4X system. Hmm. Focusing on how it helps understand price compression, expansion, that whole jackknife dive analogy really helps visualize it. It really does. And how it connects to trends, those three bar swings, giving early warnings. And critically, how you use those breakouts for precise risk management with stop losses tied directly to the channel. And for those short term, scalping opportunities. Always staying with that 13 hour trend. And never forgetting confirmation. Using each moku, using oscillators to refine entries within the trend. It's a whole system approach. Definitely. So if you, the listener, want to really get deeper into this, see more examples, understand the nuances. Then checking out Cineo Kuchal's book, A Practical System for Trading 4X is probably the next step. It lays out the whole system in detail. Yeah, highly recommended if this sparked your interest. And maybe leave you with this thought. The real skill in trading, perhaps, isn't just spotting a trend. It's mastering those precise turning points. Getting that sweet spot. Yeah, that moment of minimal risk. Maximum potential. Just like that diver hitting the perfect jackknife. Knowing when the market's coiled energy is about to release, that's the finesse.
