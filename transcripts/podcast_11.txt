 Okay, let's dive in. Stepping into the world of Forex Trading, especially trying to figure out which strategies actually work and aren't just theory, it can feel like navigating a maze, right? Oh, definitely. I'm looking for that reliable path, something practical for consistent returns. Absolutely. And the sheer volume of information out there is, well, it's pretty overwhelming. Finding a clear, actionable approach, you can really trust. That's the challenge. And that's exactly why we're tackling this source material today. It's a guide that's designed to simplify Forex Trading and help aim for those consistent results. So, for this deep dive, our mission is specific. We want to pull apart the key insights from two chapters that really zero in on trading different time frames within this particular system. Right. We're looking at chapter 16, which focuses on the faster, more responsive, 13 hour trend, and then chapter 17, which zooms out a bit to the larger, maybe higher potential, five day, or weekly structure. Think of it as getting the distilled essence of these two approaches. We're going to walk through the core ideas, the specific tools they talk about, and the thinking behind it all. Okay. So, the listener can hopefully get a clear picture without needing to weigh through the whole text yourself. We're aiming to maybe highlight those, uh-huh moments, you know. Yeah. Those moments that can make a real difference. Okay. All right. Let's unpack the system, then. Starting with chapter 16, trading the 13th trend. What's the core concept here? Well, the fundamental idea in this chapter is focusing on a relatively short term trend structure, specifically one that plays out over roughly 13 hours. 13 hours. The system isn't saying you need to scout tiny moves, not at all. Yeah. It's more about identifying these faster trends to participate in consistent weekly gains. Consistent weekly gains. Hmm. That sounds like the system is building towards something specific, maybe like smaller, more frequent wins, adding up over time. Precisely. The goal they actually outline in the source for this approach is aiming for about 1% to 2% profit per week. Okay. 1 to 2%. Creating the shorter 13 hour trends is presented as a way to generate multiple trading opportunities, but within the context of the larger weekly trend. Oh, okay. If you're not just sitting there waiting for one big move, you're finding these responsive entries that kind of align with the bigger picture. That makes sense. Multiple bites at the apple, as they say, but targeted ones. The source uses a pretty vivid analogy for this responsiveness, doesn't it? It does. It compares trading the 13 hour trend to water skiing behind a boat with a 13 meter tether line. Okay. I can picture that. So the boat is the main market trend moving along. Exactly. And your position, you're the water skier connected by that tether. Now if you're on a shorter 13 meter line, you're obviously much closer to the boat than someone way back on a longer line, say 27 meters. Right. Closer in. Which means when the boat makes even a slight turn or changes direction, you on that shorter line, you react much, much faster. So the 13 meter tether is the 13 hour trend. It keeps you close to the immediate market action, allowing for quicker entry and exit compared to trading, you know, much longer time frames. That's the analogy in a nutshell. It really highlights the responsiveness of trading these shorter structures. Your agile, you can react quickly to shifts in the immediate trend. But you're not just reacting randomly. Are you? I mean, how does this faster 13 hour trend fit into the bigger picture, the larger market cycle? So the source mentions connections to longer trends. Yeah. And this is a really critical part of the system. It's not just about the short term. The source makes a specific observation about how this 13 hour trend interacts with longer term levels. OK. It points out that the 216 period congenstion on a 30 minute chart, which in this system's view represents roughly a 4.5 day trend, can act as a significant reversal point for the even larger nine day trend. OK. The 216 period congenstion, maybe let's quickly touch on that for listeners. The congenstion part of each moku, right? It's basically the midpoint of the high and low over a set period. Correct. It's similar to a moving average, but calculated differently. Gives you a sense of trend and potential support resistance. So a 216 period congenstion on M30 is looking back quite a bit, confirming that sort of intermediate 4.5 day trend. Precisely. And the source goes even further. It notes that the 216 congenstion, but this time on an hourly chart and H1 chart, serves as a major support to resistance line for the weekly trend. Ah, OK. So even when you're trading these quick responsive 13 hour moves, you're doing it with an eye on these much bigger, more stable structures defined by those longer period congenstion levels. Exactly. The idea isn't to ignore the bigger picture at all. It's about finding responsive entries that are aligned with where the larger trends seem to be headed, or maybe where they might reverse off those key levels. It's like using the shorter tether to catch the quick waves, yeah? Yeah. But always knowing which way the main ocean swell is moving. So your entries, your exits on the 13 hour, they're informed by what the 216 congenstion on M30 and H1 are suggesting about the 4.5 day and weekly trends. That's it. You're looking for spots where the immediate 13 hour trend is moving with the underlying 4.5 day or weekly trend, or maybe bouncing off one of those key congenstion levels. And what about managing risk on these faster trades? It's faster, maybe riskier. The source mentions a specific reference point for that. Yes. So the management in this 13 hour context, the source points specifically to the 13 hour breakout point. This is represented by the 27 period level on that 30 minute chart. The 27 on M30. Okay. That level acts as a key reference for setting your stops. The aim is to limit losses if the 13 hour trend suddenly reverses against you. It's about having a defined exit plan based on the structure you're actually trading. Okay. So pulling it together for chapter 16, the core idea is using the responsiveness of the 13 hour trend guided by those key longer term congenstion levels to capture frequent opportunities. Aiming for consistent weekly gains, maybe 1, 2% with risk defined by that 13 hour breakout point, the 27 and 30 level. Yeah. That's a good summary. It sounds like a method focused on compounding smaller wins by staying close to the immediate action, but still respecting that larger trend context. That's this all way to put it. It highlights the systematic nature. It's not just random jumping in and out. It's finding entries and managing risk based on specific levels tied to the trend period you're focusing on. Okay. That gives us a clear picture of the faster responsive moves. But you mentioned earlier that the maximum profit potential in this system, well, it lies elsewhere. Right. So having looked at the 13 hour, let's call it surfing. Let's talk about how this system tackles the bigger waves. Those multi day and weekly trends discussed in chapter 17, trading the 5D structure. Right. So this chapter 0's in on the 5D or the weekly structure because, well, this is where the larger more sustained moves tend to happen. And you're absolutely right. Trends don't just go straight up or down. They oscillate. They breathe. They have those natural ebbs and flows. Yeah. The source uses another analogy here, doesn't it? Similarity to the water skier, maybe, but more about the market's movement itself. Yes. It uses the analogy of a bouncing ball to describe market swings. Think about it. As a ball bounces, each successive high bounce is usually a bit lower than the last, right? Mm-hmm. Loses energy. And each low bounce might be higher than the last if it's bouncing upstairs, say. This movement mirrors the swing highs and swing lows you see in financial markets. Yeah. Identifying these turning points, the peaks and valleys of these swings, that's crucial for capturing the bulk of the bigger moves. So in an uptrend, you get higher swing lows, higher swing highs, like a ball bouncing progressively higher up a staircase, down trend lower highs, lower lows, like bouncing down. The system's built around spotting these turning points within that weekly structure. Exactly. And the primary guide for trading this weekly structure, this bigger move, is what the source calls the nine day trend line. And within the system, that specific trend line is the two 16 period cajonson on the hourly chart, the H1 chart. We mentioned that earlier as major support resistance for the weekly trend. Correct. The 16 H1 cajonson is your central reference point for navigating these weekly swings. The system is looking for opportunities to enter trades when price interacts with this level, anticipating either a continuation of the main trend, or maybe a significant reversal if price decisively breaks through it. And to really show the potential here, trading this five day structure, the source gives a specific example, doesn't it? UDUSD short trade. Can you break that down for us? Certainly. The details of short trade entered on Aussie dollar, a UDUSD at 0.6862. Now the signal that triggered this trade, according to the source, was when the Chikuspan 27 are crossed below the nine day cajonson. Okay, let's pause just briefly on Chikuspan. That's another Ichimoku element, the lagging span, right? It plots the current closing price, but shifted backwards. That's right, shifted back in time. By a set number of periods. Here, 27 hours, so just over a day's worth of price action, its main use is kind of confirmation, isn't it? So the price shifted back is above or below past price or key lines. Exactly. Helps confirm a trend or potential reversal. So the signal here was that 27 hour Chikuspan crossing below the nine day cajonson, signaled weakness. Got it. Weakness signaled. And the exit point mentioned in the example came later, down to 0.6615, the trigger for getting out. It was when the Chikuspan 27 are crossed back above that nine day cajonson. Wow. Okay, from 0.6862 down to 0.6615, that's what, nearly 250 pips on a single trade. That really does underscore that maximum profit potential idea for the weekly structure. It absolutely does. That example really demonstrates the kind of significant gains that are possible. When you successfully identify and ride one of those major swings within the weekly trend, guided by levels like the nine day cajonson and confirmed by signals like that Chikuspan cross. Not just about one big entry and exit based on that main signal, is it? The source also suggests ways to capitalize on movements within that larger swing. Yes, exactly. While you're riding the main five day trend, the market will still have smaller retraces, right? Those temporary moves against the dominant direction pullbacks pullbacks. Pullbacks. Exactly. The system mentions identifying these using tools like the SDC 27 hour indicator. These retraces are presented as opportunities to take additional trades, but always in the direction of the main nine day trend. Wow. Effectively adding to your position or taking new smaller positions during dips in an uptrend or maybe rallies in a downtrend compounding your exposure to the main weekly direction. Adding during pullbacks, that takes confidence in the main trend and a clear way to spot those smaller retraces. And the source list quite a few tools used alongside cajonson and Chikuspan to help with this, doesn't it? It does. Yeah. The system employs several indicators to help identify trends, swings, those retracement entry points and manage the trades. It mentions Chikuspan, which we've discussed. Donchi and channels, Kijunson bands, something called Echiband SDC. And it even refers to SAR and E-Mars in other parts of the book. Okay. Quick rundown. Donchi and channels that usually show the highly range over a period good for volatility and breakouts, Echiband, presumably related to the Echimoku cloud structure. Yes. Echiband likely refers to components of the Echimoku cloud, which visually represents support, resistance, trend, using multiple calculations. Right. Echiband SDC 27-R sound like maybe custom indicators for this system used for spotting those retraces you mentioned. That seems to be the case. Yeah. Specific tools for identifying those smaller counter trend moves within the main trend. And SAR, of course, often used for trailing stops and EMAs. Well, standard, exponential moving averages. So it's a blend. It combines elements from standard indicators like Echimoku, EMAs with potentially custom tools like SDC to create its specific framework. How is risk managed when trading these larger, potentially more profitable, five-day structures? Must be key. Oh, absolutely paramount. Regardless of the time frame, the source really stresses aiming for a strong, reward-to-risk ratio on trades, specifically targeting three to one or even four to one. Right. So for every dollar or pip, you're aiming to make three or four back. Exactly. That's crucial. You might not win every single trade, nobody does. But if you're winning trades are significantly larger than you're losing ones, you can still be profitable overall. Makes mathematical sense. And the source gives a specific method for setting stops, too, particularly referencing the spread between what it calls the 216 high and 216 low aligns. These seem to be bands related to that main 216 period Key Jensen. Bands around the Key Jensen, maybe like a volatility channel or something? Could be, yeah. Representing a measure of volatility or a channel around that key level. It gave an example where the difference between the 216 high and 216 low was only like 14 pips. That implies these bands can provide quite tight specific levels for placing your stop loss. They offer a structural point derived from the market's own recent movement, rather than just picking an arbitrary number of pips away. It aligns stops with the system's defined levels. And the source also reiterates broader risk principles, so found elsewhere in the book. Like risking no more than 2% of your total equity on any single trade and keeping your total leverage below 30x, standard but essential risk management. Okay, so summing up chapter 17, then the focus shifts to that larger five day or weekly structure offers the biggest profit potential by trading the natural swing highs and lows, guided fundamentally by the nine day trend line, the 216 H1 Key Jensen. And the system uses a mix of indicators to pinpoint entries, manage risk, strong emphasis on reward to risk ratios and using specific structural levels like those 216 Kajunsen bands for stops. Right. It's really about identifying the dominant longer term structure and then having a clear defined method using these specific indicators and levels to actually participate in those moves, while always, always keeping strict risk control. This has been a really fascinating deep dive into these two chapters. We've explored how the system approaches the market across different timescales from the responsive 13 hour trend. Yeah, the water skiing one offering frequent entries for maybe consistent smaller gains visualized with that water skiing analogy and then moving out to the larger higher potential five day structure navigated by identifying market swings like a bouncing ball, guided by key indicators like that nine day Kajunsen. We've touched on the specific tools and critically the risk management ideas that underpin both the approaches and this framework. Yes, I think the key takeaway is that this system moves beyond just generalized advice. You know, it provides a structured method. It's based on comparing current price to past prices over specific periods, defining trends with tools like Kajunsen and Chico span and using specific levels for managing the risk that offers a discipline framework. It definitely feels more intentional, more rule based compared to just say eyeballing charts or only relying on simple moving averages alone. It provides that clear set of criteria for making decisions, which is absolutely essential in trading, I think. So bringing this back to you, the listener, what is this all imply? These chapters we've looked at, they seem to suggest that achieving consistent profit and forex might not be about trying to predict the markets every single twist and turn with perfect accuracy. Probably impossible anyway. Right. But maybe it's more about identifying the dominant underlying structure, whether that's the quicker 13 hour flow or the larger five day swing and then having a disciplined rule based system for entering, managing and exiting positions within that structure. And crucially, keeping your potential loss a small and tightly defined relative to your potential gains. What does that suggest about your own current approach to understanding and interacting with financial markets?
