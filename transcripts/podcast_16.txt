 In any field, really, but especially finance trading, there's this one core topic. It's what protects you, allows for growth, and well, dictates if you build wealth or just chase losses. You're absolutely right. It's a risk management. Exactly. The big win headlines, but true mastery, long-term success versus, you know, flaming out quickly. It isn't about how much you make when things go well. It's all about handling the downsides, the inevitable losses. And that's precisely where we're plunging in today. Our deep dive focuses squarely on chapter 22 of Suniel's Guide, a practical system for trading Forex. The whole chapter, just risk management. Yeah. And Suniel's core idea, the one-e-hammersome, is pretty powerful. Anyone can handle profits. Easy. It's the losses. Those are what can really knock you off course. So this chapter is about getting control, right? Mastering risk to handle that unpredictability. That's the goal, gaining tangible control by truly mastering your risk. Okay. So what does mastering risk actually look like according to Suniel? He breaks it down into four core pillars. He does. But he immediately points out, and this is key, they aren't all equally critical at the outset. Ah, interesting. So which ones does he say we have to nail down first? So the four are, one, how much equity you risk. Two, where you set your stop loss. Three, the timing of your trade. And four, the rewards you expect. Okay. But the real focus, the nondegotiable part, is on the first three. Your capital risk, your stop loss, and when you enter, those are paramount. The reward comes later as a consequence. Exactly. You control the risk factors you can control. The market offers the reward if you've done that diligently. That makes a lot of sense. Control your inputs. And speaking of control, or maybe lack of it, Suniel jumps right into busting some common myths, doesn't it? Oh, yeah. Let's talk about the tight stop myth. You hear it all the time. Use tight stops for low risk. Why does Suniel say that's flawed thinking? Such a common belief, but yeah, he argues it's pretty dangerous. Setting tighter stops doesn't automatically mean lower risk overall. What it does mean is you significantly increase the chances, the probability of actually getting stopped out. So more frequent losses, potentially. Precisely. You might think you're limiting the damage portrayed, but you're making it much more likely that even small normal market wiggles will kick you out of a potentially good position. But doesn't the amount lost matter most? I mean, the impact on your actual account balance. Absolutely. And then impact depends on two things. The percentage of capital you risked in that trade and how off of those stops get hit. Right. So if you risk say 2%, but you super tight stops that get hit constantly, you can still bleed your account dry. Today implies you want low impact and low probability of getting it. It's about managing both variables, not just the stop tightness and isolation. You want to avoid that death by a thousand cuts. Okay, that clarifies things. And it leads right into the famous 2% risk rule. Most people hear that and think, okay, risk 2% on one trade and that's it. But Suniel adds a twist, right? Going beyond the single 2% trade. Yes. This is a really important clarification he makes. It's not about just taking one shot. He suggests, well, he advocates for flexibility. If the market moves against your initial entry, which happens. Of course, he says you can consider adding a second trade, maybe at a better price point, if the setup still looks good. The key thing though, the absolute rule is that you still maintain a maximum 2% risk per position. Ah, so it's not doubling down on risk. It's potentially scaling in or averaging into a position, but keeping the risk on each part controlled. Exactly. It allows you to build a position more strategically, maybe end up with two trades, both low risk individually, aiming for both to work out if the market turns your way. It's quite different from just one shot and done. That feels like a much more, well, adaptable strategy, which brings us to pillar number three. Timing. Suniel calls it critical. Why is patience so vital, especially during corrections? It's so tempting to jump in and try to catch the bottom. It really is tempting, isn't it? But Suniel is very clear. You simply cannot predict, not reliably anyway, when a correction is truly over. Trying to buy the exact bottom, especially with tight stops during volatile corrections, is just, well, it's a high risk gamble. You just get chopped up by the volatility. Pretty much. You get whipsawed, the market bounces, drops again, stops you out. It's not a high probability way to trade. So if predicting the end is out, what's the disciplined approach? Just weigh indefinitely. Or does Suniel give us something more concrete to look for? It's patience with a plan. He says the best opportunities, the highest probability ones come after the price is clearly started moving in your intended direction again. You wait for confirmation. Aligning with the trend after it's reestablished itself. Precisely. Don't try to front-run it. Join it once it's moving. And he gets specific here. He talks about waiting for at least the 13-hour trend to align. How do we actually see that using his system for someone maybe not deep into itchimoku? Right. He uses specific indicator settings. For example, the Chiku Span, which is part of the Himoku system. He looks at Chiku Span 162 on a 5-minute chart or Chiku Span 27 on a 30-minute chart. Okay, Chiku Span, that's the lagging line, isn't it? It plots the current price back in time. Exactly. How it interacts with past price action tells you a lot about the trends, strengthen momentum. So these specific settings help confirm that the underlying 13-hour trend is solid and moving your way before you jump in. Now 13 hours, that number 13 seems important in Suneo's work. Why 13? Not 9 or 12 or something else. It's interesting, isn't it? He actually comments on the 9-hour trend. Noting it's not a prime number, and he finds its signals can be erratic. 13 however is prime. It's also a Fibonacci number. And his research and testing suggest it provides a much more stable, reliable trend signal. Fascinating. Based on mathematical properties influencing market signals. That seems to be his finding, yes. It leads to more predictable outcomes in his system. And sticking with timing and confirmation, he also mentions the stable 5-day breakout, the SDC 5D. How does waiting for that signal affect the odds of your stop loss getting triggered? His observation is pretty powerful here. When you initiate trades after price, confirms a breakout above or below this SDC 5D level, which signals a significant 5-day move, the probability of your stop loss being here goes down dramatically. So, good timing makes the stop less likely to be needed. In essence, yes, it reinforces his point. When you enter, based on strong, confirmed trend signals, is often more critical for success than the exact stop loss level itself. A well-timed entry starts you off with the odds more in your favor. Okay, so we've got the concepts. The key pillars, busting myths, the crucial role of timing. But how do you implement all this consistently? Day in, day out without emotion. Sunil introduces his risk management dashboard. Sounds essential. What it is, he calls it non-negotiable. It's basically a specialized Google finance spreadsheet. It's your command center. And he's pretty blunt about it. Like skip this and you're asking for trouble. Unequivocal. Yeah. He basically says, trying to manage risk in your head or on the fly, guarantees poor performance. This dashboard pulls live prices, traction positions, monitors the key trends, it keeps everything objective. So, it's a practical tool, not just theory. And it needs daily input. You mentioned manually updating six values before trading. That's right. So, in each session, you feed a key data points from your charts. Things like the SDC27 on M30 for the 13.5 hour breakout. The SMET21 at Chikosban 27 to gauge the 13 hour trend direction. Okay. Also longer term stuff like Chikosban 216 for the weekly trend. Case in 216 at CS27ers for managing ongoing trades. The big SDC243 for the five day breakout. And even the SDC37 on M15 for the current nine hour breakout. Wow. That's quite a few inputs. The point is to get a multi-layered view of the market conditions. Exactly. It forces you to look at the market systematically across different time frames before you even think about putting on a trade. Takes the guesswork out. And once you've fed it this data, what does the spreadsheet calculate for you? It does the heavy lifting. It calculates your precise risk in PIPs for a potential trade, the optimal position size based on your account and risk rules, the ideal entry level, and your profit target. It just spits out the numbers based on the rules and the current market data. Very much. Takes the emotion and calculation errors out of the equation. And for placing those crucial start losses, does the dashboard help identify the best levels based on Cineal's system? Yes. Based on his research using those inputs, he finds the most stable levels tend to be related to the weekly trading line that case in 216K at CS27AD value and that five day breakout, the SDC5D. They act as more robust support or resistance than arbitrary levels. Oh, okay. Let's make this concrete. Say you have a $1,000 account, you stick to the 2% rule, so $20 risk or trade. The dashboard based on current volatility maybe calculates its stop loss of, say, 14 PIPs. How does it help with position size? Simple. You plug in the $1,000 equity at the $20 risk, the 14 PIP stop. The dashboard instantly tells you the maximum position size you should trade is about $6,390 or .06 L. Ah, so it forces discipline. No guessing, no feeling lucky. It sizes the trade precisely to your predefined risk tolerance and the current market condition. Exactly. Capital protection first, always. And profit targets. What's the rule there? He recommends setting your take profit at twice the risk. So if your stop is 14 PIPs, your target is 28 PIPs away. Or if you risk $20, you aim for $40 profit. A 1 to 2 risk reward ratio. Generally, yes. And importantly, he advises placing that take profit order automatically when you enter the trade. Set it and forget it, basically. Avoid fiddling with it based on fear or greed. Makes sense. Discipline again. Finally on the dashboard and overall control, Sunil repeats a critical rule about leverage. What's the limit and what's that analogy he uses? The rule is strict. Never exceed 25x to 30x leverage based on your account equity. Maximum. And the analogy is brilliant. He says leverage is like gasoline, used carefully to give you power, amplifies results, but get careless, used too much. Exactly. To disaster, wipes you out incredibly fast. It demands respect and extreme caution. It's a tool, not a toy. That gasoline analogy really drives it home. All right. So we've got the mechanics, the dashboard, the rules, this all points towards Sunil's goal. Consistent profit. He talks about small gains compounding, right? He does. His target might sound modest, maybe aiming for a consistent 1% profit per week. But the power of compounding that week after week. It adds up significantly over a year. Huge. It can far outperform traditional investments. His philosophy isn't about hitting grand slams. It's about hitting singles and doubles consistently, small, manageable, repeatable wins that build wealth steadily. A marathon, not a sprint mindset. And for any system to work like that, he says it needs positive expectancy. What does that mean in practical terms? Positive expectancy just means that over time, your winning trades make more money than your losing trades lose. Statistically, it's your average win multiplied by your win rate versus your average loss multiplied by your loss rate. The win side has to be bigger. So it's your statistical edge. Even with losses, the system is designed to come out ahead long term. That's the core idea. You need that edge. And Sunil boils all this down to some core directives, non-negotiable rules for success. Can we recap those quickly? Sure. First, trade only with the main trend. Don't fight the current. Make sense. Second. Keep a detailed trading diary. He calls it your first friend. Learn from every trade winner lose. Crucial for improvement. Fourth. Never risk more than 2% of equity on any single trade. Protect your capital. The bedrock rule. And fifth. He'd leverage below that 25x to 30x limit. Remember the gasoline. Got it. These aren't suggestions. They're foundational rules for his system. Absolutely. And one last point, he highlights the number of things that he's going to do. Absolutely. And one last point, he highlights a specific trend line he finds particularly valuable for holding positions longer term. Yes. He mentions the 36-day trend line. He finds that aligning trades with this longer term trend allows for more patience, holding through smaller fluctuations, aiming for more substantial gains, without feeling rushed to take profits too early. Interesting. A sort of anchor for longer holds within the system. Seems that way, yes. Helps capture those bigger moves when they happen. This whole approach, Senel outlines in chapter 22. It's so systematic, so disciplined. Rules, calculations, tracking. It's quite a contrast to just intuitive decision making, isn't it? Definitely. It's about removing emotion and subjectivity as much as possible. So for you, listening, as we wrap up this deep dive, what was your aha moment? What really clicked? It was that maybe rethinking tight stops. That maybe they aren't always the safest bet. Or perhaps the nuance on the 2% rule, the idea of potentially adding a second position carefully. Or maybe it was the emphasis on timing, waiting for that 13-hour trend confirmation instead of trying to guess bottoms. Or perhaps the sheer practicality of the risk management dashboard, seeing how you could build a system to enforce discipline. Could be the idea of compounding small wins, too, focusing on consistency over home runs. And thinking bigger picture, how could applying these kinds of rigorous risk principles, objective rules, understanding probabilities, strict adherence impact your other financial decisions, or even how you approach complex choices elsewhere in life? It's a mindset shift, really, applicable in many areas. If this sparked your interest, maybe dig deeper into some of those indicators, so nail users, ChicoSpan, S.D.C. Kason, just to understand their purpose in his system. Or, hey, maybe even try setting up a simple version of a risk dashboard yourself in a spreadsheet. Just playing with the concepts can be really insightful. It's all about building that knowledge, building that discipline step by step. Thanks for joining us on this deep dive into risk management.
