 Welcome to another deep dive. Today we're stepping back, way back from the minute by minute charts and forex. We want to look at the bigger picture, the hidden long-term rhythms. You know, it's so easy to get caught up in the daily noise. Absolutely, it's constant. But what if you could anchor yourself? Spot the really big shifts coming, maybe decode the market's own internal waves before they, well, before they really take hold. That's the key question, isn't it? Right. So that's our mission today. We're diving into chapter 19 of snail kushals, a practical system for trading forex. It's a great book, really focused on practical discipline methods. Very practical, yes. And we're going to explore how its ideas on annual trends can act as, well, a long-term guide and even an early warning system. Hopefully, help you get a more stable strategic view. What's truly fascinating here is how this kind of approach fundamentally shifts your focus. You know, while all the headlines scream about daily volatility and forex. Yeah, that's what grabs attention. Exactly. But understanding the deeper annual rhythm, say for a pair like HD, USD, that's a potential game changer. It impacts your whole strategy and crucially how you manage risks. Right. Risk management. So, you know, I think Crystal Ball predicting every little wiggle, it's more about identifying those powerful underlying currents and trying to align with them. That gives you a serious edge against, you know, all the short-term chaos. That makes a lot of sense. So to really get a handle on these underlying currents, let's start where the book does with what it calls the failsafe anchor, the 52-week trend. When we talk about this annual trend and forex, what are we actually looking at? And why is this 52-week perspective so, so vital? Okay, so the 52-week trend really is described as that ultimate long-term guide. Think of it like the main current and huge ocean. Okay. It's the failsafe anchor because it helps you keep perspective when all the smaller waves are crashing around. Now, for figuring out the annual direction for odd USD, the book points to the chick who's been. The chick who's been, right? Part of it you've got to go. Exactly. Said it to 52 weeks and it's critical. It basically plots the current price 52 periods back. So you visually see right away, are we higher or lower than a year ago? It shows you the slope, the direction of that big long-term move. I see. So it's a quick visual check on the annual direction. Precisely. And then if you want to trade within that established annual trend, the 52-week congenstion acts as your reliable midpoint. It's kind of like a stable long-term moving average. Helps you stay aligned. So it's about seeing the whole forest, not just getting lost, looking at individual trees day to day. Perfect analogy. When you trade with these bigger, longer-term trends, your inherent risk just goes down significantly. Even if shorter trends go against you sometimes. Yeah, even if you have daily or weekly sub trends pushing the other way occasionally, the main current is still pulling in your favor. It's like paddling upstream versus just letting the river carry you. Which one sounds easier? Definitely letting the river carry you. Right. And while 52 weeks gives you that huge view, the book mentions people often use, say, 26-day or 50-day structures to trade within it, or really anything from 24 to 60 days. So it doesn't have to be exact? Well, the insight is that being approximately right is often good enough when you're dealing with these massive trends. And what's interesting, you know, if you look at a 36-week superdontion setting, it actually works out to be about two-thirds of the 52-week annual range. Which kind of mirrors that 243-day number being roughly two-thirds of a 365-day year? Ah, that's fascinating. These numerical relationships popping up. It is. It suggests these kinds of cycles, these roughly two-thirds of a year movements, are often significant, definable trends within that bigger annual picture. That's a great point about being approximately right for the long term. And you just mentioned the 243-day idea. Now, the book really digs into this. This 243-period breakout. It sounds like a really key discovery. It is significant, yes. How does this specific number work as like an early warning system for those big annual moves, almost like the market setting up a flare? Yeah, that's a good way to put it. The 243-period breakout, especially on a daily chart, is presented as a critical long-term doncheon channel breakout. Just quickly, doncheon channel that's the highest high and lowest low over a set period, right? Yeah. It shows volatility. Spot on. So this 243-day breakout isn't just some arbitrary number. It signals a potential major long-term shift in that annual rhythm. It could help you anticipate big trend changes before they become obvious to the crowd. Okay, so it's more than just the breakout itself. Yes, what's really powerful, according to the book, is monitoring the number of smaller, say, 36-day subwaves that happen inside that 243-day annual breakout structure. So counting waves within the breakout? Exactly. That count gives you vital clues about how healthy the trend is and whether it might be getting ready to reverse or keep going. Right. I think the book gives some historical examples for IUSD. Could you walk us through one or two just to see how this pattern plays out? Sure, absolutely. Looking at IUSD history, the book points out a few key periods. For example, the big uptrend from January 2016 to April 2018. During that time, the 243-day annual breakout structure contained 11 of those 36-day subwaves. 11 subwaves. Right. Another uptrend, March 2020 to October 2021, that one had seven subwaves inside its 243-day structure. So multiple waves indicating a strong trend. What about downtrends? Same idea, just reversed. The downtrend from April 2018 to June 2020 that had nine subwaves. And the more recent big one, November 2021 to March 2024, that contained a pretty remarkable 17 subwaves. Wow, 17. Yeah. So these consistent multiple wave counts inside the 243-day structure, they really seem to provide strong evidence about the trend's maturity and its underlying strength. Those are really clear examples of the pattern. But markets aren't always neat, are they? The book mentions a specific uncertainty example that really stands out as a red flag. It does, and this is where that early warning aspect really kicks in. The period since October 2024 is highlighted as being particularly interesting. Okay, what happened then? Well, according to the book, the 243-day annual structure collapsed soon after just one wave of 36 days. Just one wave. After seeing trends with 7, 9, 11, even 17 waves. Exactly. That's presented as a stark warning sign. It suggests something unusual is happening, maybe an unstable market phase. It's a sharp deviation from the typical impulse wave behavior, which usually has five or more subwaves. So seeing just one wave after a long run is like, the market hitting Drake's heart or signaling deep uncertainty. It seems to be the interpretation, yes, of potential loss of momentum. And as the book notes, based on its analysis at the time of writing, AUD was in a downtrend with a 36-day breakout count of four. Four waves. Suggesting, based on the patterns, that another monthly downwave might be expected within that broader annual downtrend. This whole pattern of impulse waves having many subwaves and corrective waves having just a few seems pretty consistent. Recognizing when it breaks down is key. That's incredibly useful context. So let's zoom in a bit. What does all this mean for those smaller movements, the subwaves within the big annual trend? How does this idea of wave counting give us an edge, even if it's not perfect? Right. So this leads us neatly into wave counting, but adapted specifically for this system. We're focusing on counting those 36-day subwaves within the 243-day annual structure. Okay. Now many people, myself included sometimes, find traditional, Elliot wave counting on, like a naked price chart, incredibly confusing. The author actually says he gave up on it for that reason. Oh, okay. That's relatable. But this system offers what it calls a shortcut method. It gives you a practical, much simpler framework to work with. So it avoids that really abstract, subjective kind of wave counting that often puts people off. It makes it more... Acturable? Precisely. It simplifies things massively by boiling movements down into two main types. Impulse waves and correction waves. Impulse and correction. Impulse waves move with the main trend direction. They're usually made up of more subwaves, typically 5, 7, 9, 13, sometimes even more. They show strong directional power. Got it. And correction waves. Correction waves move against the main trend. They're generally shorter, usually only one or three subwaves. Think of them as pauses, maybe profit-taking, or just temporary pullbacks before the main trend likely kicks back in. Okay. That distinction sounds like it could offer some valuable clues about what might happen next. How does knowing this help a trader anticipate things? What provides quite a bit of predictive insight, relatively speaking, the system explains that a correction wave, the ones with a one or three count, is usually followed by another impulse wave, meaning five or more counts. Ah, so you can anticipate the next likely type of move. Exactly. It gives you strong clues about the market's probable next step. Now the book is clear, it's not perfect science. Though a crystal ball. No crystal ball. The author describes his accuracy as often uncanny, and it definitely gives you a valuable edge compared to someone trading without this deeper understanding of the trend structure. So it helps you judge if a trend might be getting tired, maybe ready to reverse. That's a key application. It helps determine if a trend is mature and about to reverse, letting you anticipate shifts instead of just reacting after the fact. And the practical way to do it, as we said, is counting these 36 day waves inside those larger 243 day annual breakouts. Right. Connecting the big picture with the smaller movement. Precisely. It links the macro annual view with the micro-intra-annual movements. It provides a pretty comprehensive and surprisingly often accurate framework for making strategic trading decisions. This deep dive has really, I think, laid out a very solid framework for thinking about Forex Markets with that crucial long-term perspective. We've looked at the 52 week trend as that essential anchor. Mm-hmm. Fail-safe. The 243 period breakout can function as a really valuable early warning for those major shifts. Yeah, potential heads up. And explore how counting these internal waves can offer predictive clues. This kind of knowledge really gives you the listener a structure, a way to approach Forex with, hopefully, more confidence in strategic foresight. It helps filter out some of that distracting daily noise and focus on the signals that potentially matter more in the long run. Indeed. You know, this raises an important question for you to think about. How might truly understanding these long-term cycles and their internal structures, especially when they break the usual patterns, like that weird single wave breakout we talked about? How might that become your most powerful tool, not just in Forex, but maybe across financial markets? It's really about developing a deeper intuition for the market's larger story, going beyond just reacting to headlines or short-term blips, so maybe consider. How could recognizing this underlying rhythm of the annual trend potentially transform your whole approach, helping you spot those higher probability opportunities and manage your risk with much greater clarity?
