 Welcome to the Deep Dive. We're the show that unpacks complex info, giving you those essential nuggets of insights so you can get well-informed, fast. Today we're diving into, well, a really fascinating set of sources about Forex trading. Specifically, we're looking at it through the Discipline Lens of Sunil Kuchal's methodology. Our mission really for this Deep Dive is to explore some key technical indicators, Sunil or SK, as we might call them uses. We want to move beyond just defining a trend and really uncover how tools like Parabolic Saur, Bantee D, and Williams-Prasaur work together. How they form a cohesive system. Think of this as your shortcut, maybe, to getting a handle on how these powerful indicators combine from more disciplined and hopefully more effective trading. Okay, let's unpack this. Yeah, and what's really interesting here is how SK, you know, it's someone with over two decades in finance, just distills all that experience into a very practical, very disciplined approach. He really hammers home the point that no single indicator is ever the whole picture, the whole system. It's more like a toolkit, right, a collection working in harmony. So today we'll see how the specific trend following tools interact with what are called oscillators and how that interaction gives you clearer signals, better entry points, and crucially much better risk management. Okay. He touched on trends before, but just for a quick recap on SK specific view, he defines a trend not just as like a general direction, but more precisely as the slope of the price structure. He compares the current price to the price from a specific number of periods ago. So for instance, if the current price is higher than it was, say, 13 hours ago, then that 13 hour trend is up. Simple as that. It's about being really precise. Exactly. Precision is key. And building right on that, we get this idea of a trend line, but it's not always that straight line you draw yourself. Senail introduces the parabolic SAR, SAR for short as another way to think about a trendline, a dynamic one. What's really unique is how visual it is. It shows up as these dots, either above the price bars or below them. So if the price is generally rising, the dots are trailing below. If it's falling, they're above like a guide. Okay. And it essentially provides this trailing stop and reverse mechanism. It moves with the price. So it gives you very, very precise points for setting your stop losses or even trailing your profits as the trend continues. Ah, so it's not strictly a trend indicator by his slope definition, but it acts like one kind of yeah, it approximates it. And it's a major tool for risk management then. Okay. So what about the settings? Does SK recommends specific ones and how do you actually apply them? He does. He specifies two main settings. And this is based on a lot of back testing and experience. There's a yellow setting, which is 0.006, 0.024. That's the acceleration factor in the maximum step. And then there's a magenta setting 0.003, 0.01 underway. Now it's really crucial he points out that SAR can get choppy, unreliable on very low time frames. Too much noise. Right, volatility. Exactly. So he strongly advises using it only on charts that are M5, that's five minute or higher, nothing lower. Okay. So the yellow setting 0.006, 0.0024. This one's best displayed on an H1 in hourly chart. Using it on the H1 helps you spot the bigger dips and rallies within the main trend. Then you might zoom into an M5 chart to actually time your entry or exit using other tools. Okay. So H1 gives the context for M5 action. Precisely. And the magenta setting 0.003, 0.012. That's specifically for the M30, the 30 minute chart. And here's the clever bit. This magenta setting on the M30 gives you almost the exact same visual signal as the yellow setting does on the H1. Oh, interesting. Yeah. So it offers convenience, right? You can monitor the same essential trend picture across different common time frames without constantly flipping charts. That's really smart building in that practical convenience. So the rule seems pretty clear then. Sar, dots below the price. You only think about going long, buying. Longly long. Dots above only short positions selling. How much does having such a clear objective rule simplify things for a trader? Takes the emotion out maybe? Emensely, it filters everything. You're immediately removing the temptation to trade against the primary move shown by the SAR. If that H1 yellow SAR is below price, confirming an uptrend, your mind is just focused. Okay. Where's a good buy opportunity? You're not distracted by thinking about shorting. It aligns your strategy instantly. Right. It keeps it disciplined. Okay. So following the trend is one piece. But SK also stresses understanding the the short term picture. Where the market is right now. And that brings us to oscillators. Is there a main job in a trading system like this? Oscillators play a really vital complementary role. Think of it like this. If the trend indicator like SAR tells you the river is flowing north. Okay. The oscillator tells you if the water level right where you are is unusually higher, unusually low for that river right now. So the signal whether a market is potentially overbought, prices gone up too fast, might pull back or oversold, drop too fast, might bounce. You've been that main friend. Exactly within the trend. Pinpoint potential turning points for those short term dips and rallies. They measure momentum, the speed of price change. Got it. So they help find those tactical opportunities within the strategic direction. Let's unpack one. Everyone knows MTD. Moving average conversion divergence. How does SK use this? Right. They MAD. It's a classic momentum indicator. Yeah. Sineil uses the standard settings 12, 26 and nine. Basically it's comparing a faster 12 period exponential moving average in EMA with the slower 26 period EMA. The difference between those two moving averages is the core MAD line. Then, a nine period average of that difference is plotted as the signal line. But Sineil actually prefers to visualize the difference between the MAPD line and its signal line using a histogram. Those vertical bars above and below a zero line. Oh, the histogram view. Why that? It finds it visually clearer, often faster to interpret. You can see the momentum building or fading as the bars get taller or shorter or across the zero line. It's maybe more intuitive than waiting for two lines to cross. Think of it like a momentum gauge. Makes sense. Quick or visual cues. But you mentioned earlier, sometimes these tools can be blunt. What are the pros and cons of Mankede in SK's system? Yeah. So the pro is, it's very popular for a reason. It's good at showing strengthening or weakening trends that convergence and divergence of the moving averages clearly signals shifts in momentum. Big bars above zero, strong bullish momentum, big bars below, strong bearish. However, the con, as Sineil points out, is that it can be a bit slow to react sometimes, especially when the market gets really volatile and prices are lipping around. Why slow? Because it's based on moving averages, which by definition lag price a bit, it has to wait for those averages to actually cross over in the signal line to catch up. So what that means for you, the trader, is the signal might come a little after the absolute best entry or exit point, particularly in fast markets. OK. Which is why, as K stresses, it must be used with other, often more sensitive indicators. It confirms momentum, but it's not usually your primary timing tool for getting in and out on those quick dips or rallies needs back up. Got it. Powerful for confirmation, but needs faster friends for the timing. And one of those friends you mentioned is the Williams Persar. Tell us about that one. Right. Williams Persar or just Persar. There's another momentum oscillator, but it looks at something slightly different than Mankede. The main job is to show where the current price is trading relative to the high low range over a specific recent period. Is it near the top of the range or near the bottom? Now the default setting is often 14 periods, but SK specifically uses a 13 period setting. 13 Y 13. It ties into his whole methodology using prime numbers. He believes these numbers often reflect natural market rhythms or cycles more accurately than standard settings. So 13 being prime fits his system. Interesting. Okay. So how do you read it? The readings go from zero down to negative 100. If you see your readings up near the top between zero and negative 20, that suggests over-bought conditions. Price is near the high of its recent 13 period range. Might pull back. Could do. Yeah. And readings down near the bottom between Engaz at 80 and an X100 suggest oversold conditions. Price is near the low of its recent range. You might bounce. Exactly. The key thing is, Priciar is generally much more sensitive to recent highs and lows than MaxiD. It reacts faster to short term price extremes. That makes it really ideal for pinpointing those precise dips in an uptrend or rallies in a downtrend for potential entries. It gives you those more timely signals. Okay. So putting it all together now, we've got trend tools like Parabolic Tsar setting the main direction and giving us stop levels. Then we layer in oscillators. MaxiD confirming the underlying momentum and Williams Priciar helping spot those short-term overbought, oversold moments. How does SK actually weave these together? How do they complement each other to give you the listener a clearer trading picture in practice? This is really the core of the system, how they synergize. The absolute fundamental rule, Sumail teaches, is always trade in the direction of the main longer term trend. No exceptions. The oscillators, like MaxiD and Williams Priciar, are only used to find low risk entry points within that trend. So find the dips to buy in an uptrend or find the rallies to sell in a downtrend there for tactical times. Let's paint a picture. Say you look at your H1 chart and the yellow Parabolic Tsar dots are clearly below the price bars. That confirms a solid uptrend. Your bias is now 100% long. Got it. Only looking to buy. Right. Now you want to find a good spot to get in, ideally on a temporary pullback, a dip to switch to maybe an M15 or M5 chart and watch your 13-period Williams Priciar. Suddenly you see the Priciar drop down into that Enicative 80 to an Echo 200 zone. That's your oversold signal. It's saying, okay, price has pulled back short term within this larger uptrend. That's a potential bi-trigger. Okay. The dip is identified. Then for extra confirmation, you glance at your Mancidi histogram. Maybe it was showing negative bars during that pullback, but now they're getting smaller, or it's just about to cross back above the zero line. That MaxiD action confirms the pullback momentum is fading and the main bullish trend is likely resuming. Confluence. Exactly. The confluence of the H1SAR saying uptrend, the Priciar saying oversold dip now, and the MaxiD saying bullish momentum returning, that gives you a high probability entry. You're stacking the odds in your favor. It really does sound like having that big map the SAR and then the precise GPS, the oscillators. For the exact turns, you're confirming direction and timing. Are there common ways people misuse this energy? Oh, absolutely. The biggest mistake is using the oscillator signal against the main trend defined by something like SAR. For example, seeing Williams' persaunt hit overbought 0 of negative 20. In a strong uptrend, confirmed by SAR and thinking, oh, time to sell, it's going to reverse. Counter-trend trading. Precisely. Senile system forbids that. You only use the oscillator signals as entries aligned with the SAR trend. So in that uptrend, you'd ignore the overbought persaunt a signal entirely and only act on an oversold signal as a potential buy entry. You ride the wave, you don't fight it. That makes a huge difference in probability, I imagine. It's fundamental, and Senile always emphasizes, you know, one indicator isn't a system. A system is the whole collection, working together, providing objective rules. Combining the trend context from SAR with the momentum check from MagD, and the timing signal from a pair R that leads to better entries, better exits, and crucially better risk management. It's all designed to improve your expectancy. Expectancy? Explain that a bit more. Expectancy is basically your average profit or loss per trade over the long run. You calculate it by looking at your win rate, your average win size, and your average loss size. If your system consistently produces average wins that are bigger than your average losses, even if you don't win every single trade, you have a positive expectancy. That's the mathematical edge you need to be profitable over time. Senile's combination of tools aim squarely at creating that positive expectancy, getting you into high probability trades, letting winners run appropriately using SAR stops, and cutting losses relatively quickly. What an incredibly insightful look in the Senile-Kitchell's practical system. We've really unpacked how he uses Parabolic SAR, not just for trend, but as that dynamic guide and stop loss tool. Then layering in on QD for that momentum confirmation, and Williams for SAR for pinpointing those entries. Yeah, those precise moments. Seeing how they all work together synergistically to confirm the trend and find those high probability spots. Really speaks to the power of a, well, a holistic rules-based approach. Takes the emotion out. It does. And connecting it to the bigger picture for listeners, it underlines that successful trading isn't really about predicting the future perfectly. Nobody can do that. It's about having a robust objective system guiding your actions, managing risk effectively, knowing when to enter on that dip, when to exit, and always sticking with that established major trend. And it's really a continuous journey, isn't it? Learning, discipline, discovering what works through consistent application. Absolutely. And that's really what Sunale aims to provide in much greater depth in his work. If you, the listener, want to truly match with these concepts, see detailed chart examples, get into more specific applications we've only touched on. Yeah, there's a lot more nuance. Then we definitely recommend getting a copy of Sunale-Kitchell's book, a practical system for trading Forex. It really dives deep into the full methodology, gives you that complete picture for building your own trading discipline. Well, thank you for joining us on this deep dive.
