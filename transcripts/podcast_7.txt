 Have you overlooked at the constantly shifting financial markets and just wished you had a clearer map, you know, way to cut through all the noise and spot the real trends? Yeah, that's a common feeling. Well today we're doing a deep dive into a really intriguing system. It's one that many traders, including our source for today, Sunil Kucho or SK, found to be, well, a bit of a game changer. The Ichimoku system. That's right. And for you, our listener, our mission here is pretty straightforward. Give you a solid yet concise understanding of Ichimoku's core bits. Okay. Well, unpack its origins, which are quite interesting, dig into the key components, the lines, the loud, and explore how it gives you this sort of multi-dimensional view of market insight, all through the lens of SK's practical approach, of course. And it's probably worth mentioning SK, the author of a practical system for trading forex. He didn't just like stumble upon Ichimoku randomly. No, not at all. His journey actually led him there back in 2007, but only after a pretty long search for reliable technical tools. He apparently looked into other big theories, you know, GAN theory, Elliott Wave theory, the usual suspect. Exactly. He found them, well, in his own words, quite confusing. So that backstory really highlights why Ichimoku became such a key part of his trading evolution. It genuinely stood out from the crowd forum. It really does. I mean, the fact that after trying, as he puts it, almost every technical indicator, SK found Ichimoku was the answer to gaining clarity. That speaks volumes about its usefulness. It's robust nature. Right. So yeah, our goal today is to break down this potentially complex info into clear, memorable pieces, hopefully leave you feeling well informed and maybe curious to dig even deeper yourself. Okay. So we've seen why SK gravitated towards Ichimoku. Let's dig into what actually makes the system so comprehensive. We're talking about the Ichimoku system. It's a foundational framework for market insight. Absolutely. As you said, SK adopted Ichimoku precisely because it is a comprehensive charting system, not just, you know, another indicator you slap on a chart. Its main purpose, its design, is to offer that multi-dimensional view of price action, helping traders pinpoint trend direction, momentum and those critical support and resistance levels. It's really designed to paint the whole picture right there on your chart. So instead of needing to juggle, say, five different indicators on separate panels or overlaying them messily, Ichimoku aims to bring it all together visually. Precisely. That's really where it strength lies. We integrate several key elements these lines we'll talk about, plus that very unique visual thing called the cloud, all working together to give you deeper insights than you might get otherwise. Okay. Let's start decoding these components then. We've got the Tenkinson, the Key Jensen and the Chikuspan. Can you walk us through what these lines actually represent and importantly, how they're put together? Sure thing. Let's start with Tenkinson and Key Jensen. Think of these two as your main guides for, let's say, short to intermediate term trends. The Tenkinson, which some people call the conversion line, is basically the midpoint, the average of the highest high and the lowest low over the last nine periods. It's a very responsive line reacts quickly to price changes, so it indicates that immediate short term momentum. So sort of like a faster average, but using highs and lows, not just the closing price, makes sense. And the Key Jensen, how's that different? Exactly right. On the Tenkinson, the Key Jensen or baseline is calculated pretty much the same way, midpoint of the highest high and lowest lows, but over a longer period, typically 26 periods. Oh, okay. Longer time frame. Yeah, because it looks back further, it's less jumpy than the Tenkinson. That stability means it acts a more reliable gauge of intermediate term price direction and offers, well, stronger potential support and resistance levels. When the Tenkinson crosses the Key Jensen, that's often seen as a pretty significant signal for a potential trend change. Got it. It's faster line and this slower, more stable baseline working together. Now, what about the third one, the Chiku Span? What's its unique job and how's it constructed? It sounds a bit different. The Chiku Span is different. It's often called the lagging span or the look back line. It's fascinating, actually. It provides perspective on the, quote, long term trend, but how it does it is unique. It shows the current closing price, but plotted 26 periods back in time on the chart. Plotted backwards. Okay, that sounds a bit counterintuitive. How does that help? It does sound weird at first, but it's actually quite brilliant for context. Its construction and interpretation are key. For instance, SK mentions that a reliable long term trend might be defined by the Chiku Span crossing price 13 hours ago. Or more generally, when that Chiku Span line, which is current price, remember, just shift it back, crosses above or below the price action from 26 periods ago. It signals a potential shift in the longer term trend, strength or weakness. Okay. SK also uses this great analogy. He mentions that Chiku Span 27 crossing the wake line of the boat provides reliable signals about when to potentially change direction in your trades. The wake line of the boat. That definitely sounds like one of Sinales analogies. Can you unpack that a bit? How does that relate to the Chiku Span? It is. And it's a really good one for understanding responsiveness. SK uses a water-skear analogy. He says, think about it. If our tether line with the boat was only 13 meters, we would be able to turn much faster as the boat turned as compared to a tether line of 27 meters. Right. Short or rope quicker turns make sense. Exactly. Now connect that to trading. The wake line of the boat in his analogy often represents a key level price is interacting with very frequently. It's the Kijinssen. That's stable baseline we just talked about. Oh, okay. So the Chiku Span, showing current price projected back, tells us how freely the current price the skier is moving relative to where the price and its wake Kijinssen was 26 periods ago. SK links this directly to trading responsiveness. By watching the trend a bit closer, he says, meaning using perhaps a shorter period or understanding these relationships, our trades are much more responsive to changes in trend the direction of the boat that we are following. So if the Chiku Span, current price plotted back, is clearly above the price action from 26 periods ago and maybe above the Kijinssen from that time too, it suggests strong upward momentum the skier is pulling away. If it crosses below its signals weakness, it's gauging if the current price has the strength to clear those past levels. That clicks immediately. Okay. So a shorter tether, like using a shorter period for analysis or just understanding this relationship, lets you react faster. That makes total sense for different trading styles or timeframes. Now you mentioned SK explored tons of indicators. In his book he suggests certain tools are superior to moving averages. How do these Ichimoku lines, especially the Kijinssen and Chiku Span, compare to basic moving averages? Why might SK see them as, well, better? That's a really important point. Remember, SK's journey involved testing almost every technical indicator. He landed on Ichimoku partly because he found its components offered a kind of consistency and clarity that he maybe didn't find with standard moving averages. Okay. So about a simple moving average. It's just the average of closing prices, right? It can be useful, but it can also whips all a lot and choppy markets are lag quite a bit. Yeah, they can definitely lag. Exactly. The Kijinssen though, being based on the midpoint of the high low range over a fixed period like 26, gives you this remarkably stable reflection of the intermediate term equilibrium price. It doesn't change its value constantly with every new close. It only changes if a new highest higher lowest low is made within that 26 period window. So it's less noisy. Much less noisy. That stability makes it a very reliable trend line, providing clearer support and resistance levels that often hold up surprisingly well across different chart time frames, which is a big plus for consistency. And the Chiku Span versus MAs. Well, the Chiku Span offers something completely different. That unique projection backwards gives you an immediate visual comparison. Where is the price right now relative to where it was 26 periods ago? Is it stronger? Weaker? Is it tangled up in past price action? Simple MAs just don't give you that direct historical comparison visually. It's a powerful confirmation tool or a divergence signal. It lets you see if the current price really has the oof to break free from the past. Okay. Yeah, I can see that. So it's this combination of the Kijinssen stability and consistency across charts plus the Chiku Span's unique perspective that SK likely found superior for managing risk and confirming the trend's health. They became foundational tools for him. All right. This is making a lot of sense. But now we get to the really distinctive part. The Itchimoku cloud or Kumoku looks quite different on a chart. How is this visually striking, almost mystical sounding cloud actually put together? And what's it telling us? Right. The cloud or Kumo in Japanese is definitely the most eye-catching part. And arguably one of the most powerful components of the Itchimoku system. It's formed by two lines called Senku Span A and Senku Span B. And here's where that predictive or maybe forward looking aspect really kicks in. Forward looking how so. Okay. So Senku Span A is calculated by taking the average of the Tenkinson and the Kijinssen. The first two lines we discuss. Exactly. Average those two. B-U-T. Then you plot that value 26 periods ahead of the current price bar. Okay. Projected forward. So we have Senku Span B. This one is calculated like the Kijinssen. It's the midpoint of the highest high and lowest low, but over a much longer period, typically 52 periods. And just like span A, it's also plotted 26 periods ahead. 52 periods. Wow. So that's a much longer term baseline also projected forward. Precisely. And the space between Senku Span A and Senku Span B projected out there 26 periods in the future. That is the Itchimoku cloud. So it literally creates this zone out in front of the current price. What is pretty unique compared to other indicators? It really is. That forward projection is a core strength. And what's also crucial is how it behaves. As K notes, the cloud changes color when the short term Tenkinson and Kijinssen have both crossed the baseline, where baseline often refers to Senku Span B, or more simply when Senku Span A crosses Senku Span B. And this color change. This color change has shown exactly, well, 27 periods ahead of where the current price action is happening because of that 26 period forward projection plus the current period. Okay. Wait. So the cloud itself is formed by lines projected 26 periods ahead. And its color change signaling a potential future trend shift appears 27 periods ahead. You got it. It means that Itchimoku system isn't just reacting to now. It's also in a way anticipating. It's a system of crossovers as SK puts it that waits for the Tenkinson and Kijinssen to cross the baseline Senku Span B before signaling a change in trend direction ahead of the price action. The cloud's color flipping gives you an early visual cue about a potential major shift in the longer term trend direction. So it's almost like a visual predictive MKD crossover, but shown spatially on the price chart itself. That's a great way to think about it. SK makes that comparison too. He says, the only difference is that instead of displaying a MACTI histogram, the Itchimoku system shows it by changing the cloud color ahead of the price action. Wow. It provides this really distinct visual and predictive signal. It can give traders a heads up about potential future support or resistance zones. The cloud itself acts as dynamic support resistance and signals major trend shifts, often well before some other lagging indicators might catch on. Plus, the thickness of the cloud matters too. A thick cloud suggests strong support or resistance while a thin one might imply weaker levels or an area where price could break through more easily. OK, this is a lot to take in, but a painted picture of a very integrated system. So bringing it all together, what does this mean for SK's actual trading philosophy? How does he weave Itchimoku, especially these lines, into his broader strategies? That's key. For SK, these Itchimoku components aren't just isolated signals, he fundamentally uses them as trend lines. As trend lines, even the Kijun Sen or Tsukuspan? Yes. He views a trend line broadly as a guiding mechanism for risk management settings stops, knowing where to potentially take profits and, most importantly, for identifying and staying aligned with the market's direction. What's interesting is his flexibility within that discipline. He actually states that for him, the trend line could be a Donxin channel, Kijun Sen, Tsukuspan, Sar Stop and Reverse, or E-May Exponential Moving Average. So he has a toolbox, but they all serve that core purpose of defining the trend and managing risk around it. Exactly. It shows he uses a diverse set of tools, but they all serve the same fundamental goal. Guide the trade, manage the risk. And this leads to a really critical point that comes through in Senaels' work, that Kijun Sen consistently emerges as the trend line of choice across pretty much all the trading systems he describes. So out of that toolbox, that Kijun Sen is a favorite. It's stability and reliability, which we talked about earlier. It acts as that solid, dependable anchor for figuring out the overall trend direction, and crucially, for setting logical stop losses. If you look at the examples he provides, say, around Chapter 8 in the book, you'll often see the Kijun Sen acting as that dynamic support or resistance level that price respects. It becomes that wake line about follows, guiding entries, and exits effectively. It's just very consistent. And he doesn't just use, say, the Kijun Sen on its own, right? You mentioned he combines things. Definitely not an isolation. SK really emphasizes combining indicators for confirmation. He gives examples like, it is best to combine a Chikuspan with a Donkian channel breakout to trade a reliable structure. Okay, so layer the signals for more confidence. Precisely. It's about getting confluence, reducing the chance of false signals, and ultimately, as he constantly stresses, to manage our risks better. That's the bedrock. Across all his systems, two core ideas keep coming back. First, manage our risks better, and second, always trade only in the direction of the trend. It's all about preserving your capital and making sure you're swimming with the current not against it. Right. So, to recap, we've journeyed through the Ichimoku systems origins, really dug into the roles of its key lines, the quick tankinson, the steady Kijun Sen, and the unique perspective giving Chikuspan, especially with that water-skier analogy, making sense of its responsiveness. Yeah, that's a good one. And we explored the cloud, the Kumo, its forward-looking nature, and how SK weaves all these elements, especially the Kijun Sen as a core trend line, into a philosophy focused squarely on risk management and trend following. Absolutely. But it's important to stress, this deep dive has really just scratched the surface. We've given you the foundations of SK's intricate trading methodology as it relates to Ichimoku. His book, A Practical System for Trading Forex, is just packed with much more, way more practical examples, really detailed, short breakdowns, specific strategies that bring these concept alive and can guide you step by step. You can agree more. If you're listening and thinking, okay, this sounds powerful, I want the nitty gritty. Then you really don't need to get a copy of Sunil Kuchel's book, A Practical System for Trading Forex. It contains far more details, examples, charts, everything you need to really explain these concepts and guide you properly on your trading journey. It's an invaluable resource if you want to take this further. Definitely. And maybe a final thought to leave you with. Remember that mastering the market? Well, it's an ongoing journey, it's not really a destination you just arrive at. It demands continuous learning, discipline, practice, and importantly, that willingness to adapt as markets change. Tools like the Ichimoku System are incredibly powerful, no doubt, but the real skill ultimately lies in how you apply them, how you manage your risk, understand the markets flow, and just keep evolving as a trader.
