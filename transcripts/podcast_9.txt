 Welcome to the Deep Dive. You're short cut to getting genuinely well informed. Today, we're cutting through some of the noise and forex trading. We want to look at a disciplined path towards potential financial independence, our mission. To really dissect Sonio Kucho's remarkable new book, a practical system for trading foreign exchange, it just came out this June. You've sent us your sources and we're here to pull out those key insights, those real aha moments will help you understand how to maybe navigate market trends, definitely manage risk and potentially secure those significant returns all without feeling overwhelmed. So let's get started. Yeah, let's jump in and what's truly fascinating when we look at the origins here is the Ichimoku Kinko Heo system itself. It wasn't some flash in the pan idea. It was the life's work really of a Japanese news toberman, Gushihosoda. He actually used the pen name Ichimoku Sanjin and he spent over 20 years developing it. 20 years. Yeah, meticulously researching and refining. And get this, he started before World War II. He even hired students. They were like human computers basically. Yeah. Manually running countless calculations, testing formulas. Wow, that's incredible. Like early back testing, but all done by hand. Exactly. Very much analogous to the complex simulations we run today, but you know, pen and paper stuff, decades of it. So decades of this painstaking work before it was even released publicly in 1968. And it's interesting, despite how powerful it clearly was and its popularity and Asian trading rooms for like everything currencies, commodities, stocks, it kind of remained a secret to the West until the 1990s. That's quite a lag time. It really is. And I think that history speaks volumes about its depth. And shows Ichimoku isn't just, you know, a random collection of indicators you slap on a chart. It's a purpose-built system, a holistic trend trading system. It's geniuses how it integrates everything, the lines, the cloud to give you this at a glance picture of price action. You see the sentiment, the momentum, the strength of the trend, all in one go. And those original settings, 926.52, they weren't just pulled out of thin air. Not at all. The soda chose them with incredible foresight. They represent roughly a week and a half, a standard Japanese business month, and then two months of trading days. So they were designed to reflect these natural market cycles. It gives you a really deep insight into price behavior. That foundational story is amazing, real dedication. Okay, but let's bring it forward. How does this apply in today's super fast-paced forex markets? Let's zoom in on Suneo Kuchoel's SK's specific take on this, particularly his preferred trading line. That seems pretty central to his whole system. It really is central. SK has zeroed in on the 216th period, Key Johnson, as his chosen, eachiband trading line. Now, the Key Johnson for anyone, maybe less familiar, it's basically the midpoint, highest high lowest low over a set period. Right, like a moving average, but calculated differently. Sort of, yeah. Think of it as a dynamic equilibrium line, a kind of center of gravity for price over that time frame. And for Suneo, using the 216th period, Key Johnson, well, its significance is its stability. It acts as a really reliable long-term reference point, cuts through the noise. Okay, and you mentioned risk management being paramount for SK. So how does this eachiband 216 set up with these high low bands you mentioned? How does that specifically help manage risk, maybe compared to other methods? Right, this is where SK system, I think, really shines. This is where those aha moments can kick in for a trader. The whole point of drawing these high low bands, specifically one average true range or ATR above and below that 216th, Key Johnson, is to give you crystal clear guide rails for risk. Yeah, think about it. You enter a trade, the eachiband 216 line is your sort of anchor for trend direction. And those ATR bands, they become these like laser guides defining your stop loss right at the entry point. So you're not guessing or using some arbitrary percentage stop. Exactly. The system shows you maximum risk and fine immediately. Yeah. Very tight stop loss based on actual market volatility via the ATR. So it really systematizes that critical first step in risk control? Precisely. And Sunail emphasizes this constantly. Risk management is more important than being right about the trend. That's a powerful quote. It is. And it's the core philosophy. Yeah. By taking these tight system defined stops when things go wrong, you just minimize your drawdowns dramatically. And that allows those smaller consistent wins to actually compound over time in those double digit annual returns you talk about. Is it your preserving capital? Your preserving capital. You stay in the game. The winning trades then have a chance to accumulate properly without one bad trade wiping you out. It's a, yeah, it's a game changer for discipline trading. Makes total sense. Build that solid foundation first. Okay. So we've covered entry, risk management. What about getting out? This is where it gets really interesting for me understanding when a trend might be, you know, running out of steam. Time to take profits. SK introduces the simplified approach to wave counting. It builds on complex stuff like Elliott wave, but makes it practical, right? Actionable. Absolutely. And this tackles that key question. How do you gauge trend maturity? Because as SK explains, no trend just goes straight up or straight down. They're made up of smaller moves, these sub waves. He uses his great analogy, taking your dog for a walk. Uh-huh. The dog runs way ahead that maybe comes back towards you a bit and runs forward again. Overall, you're both moving forward, but the dog covers way more ground with all its back and forth. Right. It's exagging within the main direction. Exactly. And that illustrates how scalping, trading those individual sub waves, the dog's little sprints can be really rewarding. The market ebbs and flows constantly, even inside a strong trend. Okay. So you're looking at these dips and rallies within the bigger picture. But how do you know if it's just a dip, a pullback or if the whole trend is reversing using this wave counting? That's the critical distinction. Yeah. SK helps make that clearer. He identifies two main types of waves, impulse waves and correction waves. Impulse and correction. Impulse waves are the main trending moves. The powerful surges forward, they typically break down into say five, seven, nine, sometimes even 13 or more smaller sub waves. That's the market building momentum. Gotcha. So in the long waves, on the other hand, they move against the main trend and they usually consist of just one or maybe three sub waves. These are basically phases of profit taking, a natural pause, a breather or retracement within that larger trend. Okay. So let's say you're long, the trade's working. You see a clear three wave move down against you. That could be your signal. It's just a correction, not time to bail yet. Exactly. It suggests it might just be a temporary pullback, potentially even a chance to add to the position as other factors align or just a whole tight. Then conversely. Conversely, if you're looking at a trending move, an impulse wave and you can count five or seven or nine distinct sub waves within it, that's telling you that this particular impulse is getting mature. It's getting a bit tired. So it's not about predicting the exact top or bottom? No, not precisely. It's more about gauging the exhaustion level of the current move. For example, SK talks about a five day structure. That's a common cycle. You can break that down into its waves. The wave count within that five day move can tell you, okay, are we nearing the end of an impulse? Or is this just a corrective phase within a still developing trend? And that helps inform your exit strategy. Let's you maybe book profits near the peak of a mature move rather than writing it all the way back down. Reading the market's internal rhythm, I like that. Knowing when it's taking a breath versus when it's genuinely tired. That's a good way to put it. Okay, this idea of sub waves then leaves perfectly into this other fascinating concept. How trends are nested, like charts within charts across different time frames, it sounds almost like fractals in the market, similar patterns repeating at different scales. It really is like that. SK demonstrates this nesting beautifully. He uses the analogy, think of a coastline on a map. Okay. You see the big bays, large penicillars, then you zoom in, those bays have smaller coves, zoom again, tiny inlets. It's the same kind of jagged shape just at different scales. Right, self-similarity. Exactly. In the market, it means a big, powerful trend you might see on, say, a monthly chart. Well, it likely contains smaller, similar looking mini trends within it on the weekly or daily charts. Sineg gives specific examples, like how roughly eight of the smaller 13 hour trends tend to nest inside each five day trend. Eight, 13 hour trends within a five day trend. Okay. And then taking it up another level, roughly six to eight of those five day trends often nest within a larger monthly trend. It shows us remarkable consistency, a kind of natural rhythm playing out across all these different timescales. So you're not just staring at one chart in isolation, you're understanding how these different time frames interact. That gives you a much more complete sort of multi-dimensional picture. Precisely. That's the power of it. It can give you much more confidence. And SK's brilliance, I think, is linking these patterns to market rhythms, often using specific numbers, numbers derived from Fibonacci sequences, prime numbers. So not random numbers again? You know, they reflect cycles seen all of our nature in mathematics. For instance, he uses the 27 period to define a key daily structure, helps you anticipate maybe the completion of a daily swing and the 216 period. But when we talk about for the intuband, that can represent a nine day structure, if you're looking at a 30 minute chart or even a 36 day structure on a four hour chart. So the same period means different things depending on the chart time frame. Exactly. It doesn't get totally lost in the math, but to grasp that these specific periods act as important anchor points. They give you confidence that your short-term trade, maybe on an hourly chart, is actually aligned with the bigger underlying currents seen on the daily or weekly. Writing the bigger wave, essentially. Yes. It helps you manage risk more effectively because you're making sure even your smaller gains are accumulating with the flow of the larger, more powerful trends, not fighting against them. Okay. So wrapping this up, what's the big takeaway for listeners? We've journeyed from the incredible origins of Ichimoku, you know, great Usoda's decades of work. To house Senaille Kuchal has refined its application, especially with this powerful Ichiban 216 system, where that tight risk management is absolutely key for consistency. We also unpacked that crucial idea of wave counting, using it to gauge trend maturity, knowing when it might be time to book profits. And explored this really fascinating nested nature of trends from those 13 hour moves right up to monthly cycles. It feels like it's less about just reading charts and more about understanding the market's actual rhythm. I think that's exactly right. It offers this really unique lens to view market movements. It helps you gain knowledge, not just quickly, but with a kind of depth that provides those genuine, aha moments we talked about. It's really about building a solid framework for making informed decisions, you know, instead of just getting swept away by all the noise and information overload out there. It definitely empowers you to see that bigger picture and hopefully trade with more conviction. Now, if you're truly looking to master this, well, it's complex, no doubt, but potentially very rewarding. We definitely recommend grabbing a copy of Senaille Kuchal's new book, A Practical System for Trading Foreign Exchange. It goes into far more detail, has loads of charts, practical examples, really helps you understand and apply these concepts with specific settings for your own trading. Seems like an invaluable resource. Absolutely. And maybe just a final thought for you to mull over. Consider how these patterns and rhythms, Senaille identifies in the markets, you know, the nested trends, the Fibonacci relationships, how closely they mirror patterns we see everywhere in the natural world. Think about spirals in a sunflower, the branching of trees, the way water flows, it's all strangely similar. So it raises this interesting question. Does mastering these kinds of universal patterns hold a key, not just maybe to market success, but perhaps to a deeper understanding of complex systems in general across the board? Let's take a look at what we think about.
