 You've probably heard the old adage, the trend is your friend. It's a pretty standard trading wisdom. Sure is. But what if the way we actually identify that friend, we call it trend line, what if that's holding us back, maybe making trading less safe, less smart? That's a really interesting point and it's exactly what we're diving into today. Right. Welcome back to the deep dive. We take complex ideas from sources and well try to make them clear and useful. And for you our listener, we're building on what we've talked about before regarding Cineal's practical system for Forex trading. We're going deep into chapter seven of his book. Yeah, the mission today is really to unpack what a trend line truly is according to SK and maybe more importantly what it's actually for. Exactly. We want to show you why not all trend following tools work the same, especially when you look at bigger picture charts, those higher time frames. And we'll introduce you to a combination SK flags as well, the most stable and effective he's found. So get ready. This might shift how you think about trends. It could be some real aha. Yeah. Volunteer. Okay. So let's get right into it. Cineal hammers this point home early on. There's a huge difference between a trend and a trend line. Huge difference. It's not just semantics is it it's critical for how you actually trade right? He's super clear about this. Yeah, think of it like this. The trend is the market's actual direction. It's momentum. The trend line. It's just a tool. The tool. Okay. A line you draw or maybe an indicator you use that follows the trend. It tries to hug it closely, visualize it, maybe set boundaries around it, but it is not the trend itself. Got it. So confusing the two. That sounds like trouble. It really can be leads mistakes chasing the wrong signals. Okay. So if the trend line is a tool, what's its main job? What's its purpose? Because if we know that we can judge if the tools we're using are any good. Exactly. And SK is crystal clear on this. It's number one job is effective risk management. Risk management. Not prediction. Prediction is part of it, maybe. But the primary function is protecting your capital, setting those safe boundaries. He uses some great analogies for this, doesn't he? Oh, yeah. Really vivid ones. The poisonous snake and the clear plastic box. Right. I remember that one. The lid and the bottom of the box. Those are your trend lines. They create this safe space. Protect your hand from the snake being the volatile market. So it's about containment safety. Precisely. Setting those limits. And there's another one too, the bus analogy. Ah, yeah. It's the bus riding higher than the road. Yeah. Riding maybe three feet higher. That constant elevation. That's like your trend line. Mm-hmm. You have a smooth ride over the little bumps and dips in the road, the minor trends. You're kind of floating above the immediate noise. So the trend line isn't just following. It's giving you a buffer zone. Exactly. A buffer. A safe operating space lets you ride the bigger wave without getting shaken off by every little ripple. That elevation stops you making jumpy decisions. Okay. So risk management, stability, buffer zone, that's the goal. Which brings us to the common tools. Why do they sometimes fall short, especially on those bigger time frames we care? About. Good question. We've touched on parabolic saw before. It can be a trend line tool. Right. We've seen it use that way. But SK points out it's really more suited for smaller time frames. Yeah. shorter moves. Why doesn't it work so well for the bigger picture of the long term stuff? Well, the thing with saw is it's just very sensitive. Mm-hmm. Very reactive. Too sensitive. For longer time frames. Yeah. You put it on a daily or weekly chart and it flips back and forth constantly. You get whipsawed. Whipsaws. The worst. Exactly. Those frustrating false signals that just chop up your account, hit your stop, reverse, hit your stop again. It's just too jumpy to reliably guide you through a major trend. It's like trying to ride that bus bike, dragging your feet on the road itself. Okay. That makes sense. So saw is maybe too close to reactive for the big moves. Now what about the most common tool of all? Moving averages. Maze. Maze. Everyone starts there. Very much. And SK even mentions he started with a 200-day MA but found it difficult, not quite right for his system. Yeah, he moved away from it. And the core issue with moving averages, any moving average, is that they are fundamentally lagging indicators. Lagging, meaning they're always behind. Always looking in the rear view mirror. The average pass prices, usually closing prices, so they react after the price has already moved. The trail, the action. To nail shows this really well when he compares, say, a 27-period Q Johnson with a 27-period EMA, an exponential moving average. Same period, 27, but different calculations. Totally different calculations measuring very different things. The EMA averages the closing prices over those 27 periods, smooth things out. Spanner MA stuff. Right. But the Q Johnson, it calculates the midpoint between the absolute highest highs and the absolute lowest low over those same 27 periods. Hives and lows, not just closes. That sounds significant. It's a game changer. Because think about what that means. The EMA tells you the average place the market finished each period. The Q Johnson tells you the center of the market's actual trading range during that time. The center of the whole range. Hives and lows included. Exactly. It captures the extremes. So it gives you a much more dynamic, responsive center of gravity for where the market is truly operating. It adapts faster to volatility and shifts. So less lag. Much less lag compared to an average of closes. It gives you a more real-time boundary, more like that elevated bus platform, protecting you better from sudden moves. That difference is huge when you're trying not to get left behind by a strong trend. Okay. This is making sense. So if MAs and SAR aren't quite cutting it for robust, higher time frame trend following, where do we go? This is where Sinell introduces the Q Johnson, often called the case in. It's a key part of the Ichimoku Kinko Hiyo system. Ichimoku, that cloud chart system, right? Developed way back in the 1930s in Japan. That's the one. Gochi Hosoda. It looks complex, but SK breaks down specific parts of it. And the Q Johnson is central. And what's really cool, you mentioned this, SK points out a direct link between the Q Johnson and another tool. Yes, the Q Johnson channel. He explicitly states that the Q Johnson calculation is essentially the same as finding the midpoint of a Dachin channel. So highest high and lowest low over X periods, find the middle. Both do that. Exactly the same core calculation. And that's not just a neat trivia point. It validates the Q Johnson. It shows it's based on the sound principle of tracking the actual trading range midpoint. It makes it a really dynamic adaptive trend line, a meaningful support or resistance level. It understands the market's recent volatility, not just smooth history. Precisely. Much more useful than a simple lagging average in many cases. Okay. So the Q Johnson as our dynamic midpoint trend line, but there's another piece SK always pairs it with, right? The Chikku span. Yes, the Chikku span or lagging span. The SK describes it so simply. It's just the current closing price plotted back in time. Plotted back. How far back? Usually the same number of periods is the Q Johnson. So if you're using a 27 period Q Johnson, the Q Q span is the current close plotted 27 periods ago on the chart. Okay. Seems simple enough. But he says it's powers often missed. He drastically understated, he feels and he's adamant. It is not a moving average. It's just current price shifted back. So why? Why is this simple shifted price line so powerful and why does SK insist you must use Q Johnson and Chikku span together? Ah, that's the core of it. Yeah. Because together they give you everything you need. They give you both the trend line and the trend. Trend line and trend. How? The Q Johnson acts as your dynamic baseline, your guide rail, your protective trend line like we discussed. It shows the current center of the trading range. Okay. That's the trend line. Right. And the Q Q span, even though it's just price plotted back, it gives you crucial confirmation of the actual trend momentum. It compares the current price to where the price was in the past. Comparing now versus then. Okay. So no one's airplane analogy here is just brilliant for explaining this. Yeah. Let's unpack that one. Imagine an airplane taking off. The Q Johnson, that dynamic midpoint line, that's like the airplane's intended flight path. Okay. The plan to route the guide rail. Exactly. It shows the current directional bias, the trajectory you want to follow that's your trend line. Got it. Flight path. Q Johnson trend line. No. The Q Q span. That represents the nose versus tail of the plane. It shows the plane's actual position relative to where it was moments ago. Nose versus tail, meaning current price versus past price. Precisely. If the Q Q span, which is just current price plotted 27 periods back, is above the price level that actually existed on the chart 27 periods ago, what does that tell you? Uh, that the current price is higher than the price 27 periods ago. Bingo. It confirms the 27 period trend is actually up. The plane's nose is definitively ahead of its tail over that look back period. It confirms the trend itself is real and has momentum. So it's not just a signal, it's a confirmation of the underlying trend strength. Yes, that's the power. When the Q Q span crosses the Q Johnson or maybe crosses historical price levels from behind, it's providing that vital confirmation. Okay. As SK puts it very directly, you need to base your entries or exits for longer term positions on when the Q Q span representing you, the current market reality, crosses the baseline, not just when the current price bar itself crosses it. Wait for the confirmation from the past comparison. Exactly. Wait for the market itself via the Chiku to validate the move indicated by the Q Johnson. It gives you this holistic, much safer, more confirmed view before you jump in. And you can see this playing out in the charts. He now shows in chapter seven, right? Price interacting with the Q Johnson, maybe bouncing off it. Yeah, the Q Johnson acting as support or resistance, often colored orange or magenta in his charts. And then the white Chiku span line trailing behind trailing behind, but then clearly crossing above or below past price or crossing the Q Johnson itself, confirming the move that price is making now, it visually shows that interplay, that partnership. It's like having two checks is the path clear and is the momentum actually going that way. Perfectly put. It's that dual confirmation that makes the system robust. Okay. So let's try and bring this all together, especially for you, the learner trying to make sense of all these tools. We've talked about parabolic SAR being maybe too sensitive for big moves. Right. Better for shorter time frames. We talked about moving averages lagging because they just average closes. Looking backwards too much. We touched on Donchin channels whose midpoint is like the Higinson. Sharing that core idea of the range midpoint. But after all his experience, SK's conclusion is pretty clear, isn't it? Absolutely definitive. He concludes that the Himochi system, specifically the Q Johnson used together with the Chiku's band, offers the most stable and reliable trend following system he's found. The best of the bunch for his style of trading. Yes. And why? Because as we've unpacked, this unique combination gives you both things you need. Okay. What are they again? You get the trend itself confirmed powerfully by the Chiku's band comparing current price to past price. And you get the trend line provided by the Kiginson acting as that dynamic adaptive midpoint that protective buffer trend and trend line, the whole package, the whole package. It marries that directional bias with the crucial real time momentum confirmation. And it all comes back to that core purpose, risk management. Always. He gives examples like using a longer term Kiginson, say a 216 period one on a 15 minute chart, specifically for robust loss control. It sets reliable start levels based on that dynamic midpoint. And it allows for a quicker reaction than say a very long term MA. Much quicker. He uses another analogy like having a shorter tether line when you're water skiing. A shorter line lets you react faster, just more quickly if the boat, the market, change his direction suddenly. A long lagging line means you get dragged further off course before you can correct. So this Kiginson Chiku combo keeps you closer to the action more responsive. Exactly. It's not just throwing another indicator on the chart. Sineh presents it as a complete system for guiding your trading from entry to exit to risk management, giving you the tools and the understanding to navigate with more confidence. That's the goal. Combining that clear path with confirmation of your actual progress along it. So for you, the learner, looking for that efficient yet thorough understanding, getting this synergy between Kiginson and Chiku span, that feels like a real aha moment. It really should be. It helps cut through all the noise, all the indicator overload. It gives you a clear, structured way to look at trends and manage your risk. Moving beyond those lagging indicators, right? Towards something more proactive. Definitely more proactive, more in tune with the market's actual range and momentum. So here's the final thought to chew on. If a trend line is just the guide, just the map, and not the trend or the journey itself, how often are we maybe just staring at the map, focusing only on that Kiginson line or whatever tool we use? And maybe missing the signals from the Chiku span, or other confirmations about where the market is truly heading right now. Yeah. Are we sometimes missing the journey because we're too focused on the map? That's a great question. It challenges us to always integrate the tool with the reality, doesn't it? It really does. Now, if you're finding this as fascinating as we do and you want to see more examples, more charts, get deeper into the practical application, then Senio's book, a practical system for trading forex, really goes into far more detail. Chapter 7 is key for this topic, but the whole book builds the system piece by piece. Lots more examples, different time frames, really reinforcing these core ideas, definitely worth checking out if you want the full picture. Absolutely. It's an invaluable resource for internalizing this approach.
