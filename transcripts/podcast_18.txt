 Welcome to the Deep Dive, where we take your sources and really try to extract the most important nuggets of knowledge. You're cutting through the noise. Exactly. Our mission today is to equip you with some precise, actionable insights. We're dining into chapter 26 of a practical system for trading foreign exchange, which is a really remarkable book by Senel Seasand expert. And this chapter tackles a very common trading strategy, the popular 50 day and 200 day moving averages. But, and here's where it gets really interesting. Senel doesn't just explain them. No, not at all. He offers this profound refinement. He highlights where that conventional wisdom might fall short and how his unique system provides a far more robust, much more precise approach to the markets. Yeah, what's truly fascinating here, I think, is how Senel really challenges such a widely accepted trading concept. He doesn't just dismiss the 50 day or the 200 day moving average entirely. Instead, he kind of deconstructs them. He shows us their critical limitations, especially when you use them without a deeper understanding or supplementary tools from his system. So our deep dive today is really going to distinguish between these popular moving averages and the very specific precise trading lines, Senel employees. Exactly. Things like his 36 day kjinssen and that refined 54 day email we'll talk about. It's all geared towards optimizing risk and reward. Moving beyond approximation. Right. So something that's truly mathematically grounded, you know, precision. Okay, let's unpack this then. Many of you listening might already be familiar with the 50 day and 200 day moving averages. I mean, in the world of stocks, commodities, forex, certainly, they're often seen as these fundamental trading lines. They really are standard tools. Yeah. And the basic rule is many people know it sounds simple. Parts goes above the 50 day. You think about going long, falls below you go short. And that 200 day, well, that's often seen as the sort of grand arbiter for the longer term trend, right? Signalling the big shifts. It sounds straightforward, doesn't it? Like an easy way to just ride the trends. Indeed. Yeah. It's a very popular starting point for a lot of traders. It gives you a general sense of market direction. However, Sue Nail, drawing from his, what, 22 years of experience. That's a lot of screen time. It is. He identifies some really significant pitfalls with relying solely on this simple approach, particularly when it comes to capturing, you know, substantial profits and managing risk effectively. And he illustrates this with a really compelling, almost frustrating example. Imagine the Australian dollar price falling nearly 400 pips from its 54 day moving average line. Well, that 54 day acts as a very close proxy for the common 50 day MA just for context. OK, so 400 pips down from the line, a trader sees this, follows the simple rule and goes short. Right. A potentially massive move unfolding. You've got a clear signal from the moving average cross and it looks like a simple strategy playing out. So what happens next? This sounds like it should be a great trade. Well, here's the kicker. By simply holding that short position and waiting for the 54 day moving average signal to give an exit, meaning waiting for the price to cross back above it, which is the standard rule, right? Wait for the opposite signal. Exactly. By doing that, the trader would have captured a mere 20 pips profit out of that potential 400 pit move. 20 out of 420. It's an astonishing disconnect between the market's actual movement and the profit you walk away with. Wow. I can see why as soon Dale calls that kind of outcome, a criminal waste and lost opportunity. I mean, that's got to hurt. It really does. Can you elaborate a bit on why he feels so strongly? I mean, what's fundamentally missing from that basic moving average strategy that leads to such a dramatic underperformance? That's precisely the central question. Soonal keeps coming back to what's missing. It's precision and it's a clear understanding of what a trend truly is versus just a trend line or a trading line. Oh, okay. Trend versus trend line. Yes. Traditional moving averages, while they're useful as a general visual guide, right, a trading line, maybe an indicator of overall sentiment. They are, by their very nature, lagging indicators. They're based on past prices after all. Exactly. They reflect what has already happened. So they often miss crucial turning points or they signal exits long after the prime profit taking opportunity has sailed. That criminal waste isn't just about the lost pips. No, I get that. So it's about the inherent inefficiency and maybe the psychological tool too of being in what felt like a great trade that ultimately yields so little. So his system seeks to address this by moving from these broad approximations to precise, mathematically grounded definitions. A trend for him is the quantifiable slope of price movement over a specific period. Okay, the slope. And a trading line is a precise point derived from his system for entry and exit, not just an average. That makes perfect sense. It's like waiting for the newspaper headlines to tell you what happened yesterday when you really need to know what's happening now. Well put. And speaking of longer term trends, you mentioned the 200 day moving average earlier. It's often revered, isn't it? As the ultimate long term trend indicator. How does Cinell system handle identifying those really big long term trends? Does he have an equivalent that applies his philosophy of precision there too? That's an excellent point. And yes, Cinell absolutely integrates long term analysis into his framework. Well the 200 day MA is indeed that popular gauge for significant overarching trends. It's a big picture line. Right. Cinell approaches that long term market direction with the same mathematical rigor. He doesn't just swap in a 200 day average. Instead for identifying those deep fundamental shifts that the 200 day MA tries to capture, he might refer to specific higher period each mocha components. Like the Cinecine again? Perhaps a Cinecine on a much higher timeframe, like a weekly or monthly chart. Or even higher Fibonacci derived exponential moving averages as his specific trading lines for that purpose. For instance, concepts of monthly or even quarterly trends within his system are defined by certain Cinecine periods on these higher time frames or specific long term EMAs he's calculated. And the key thing is, they're designed to be far more dynamic and responsive than a simple static 200 day average. So it's consistent. Exactly. So in the trading line in his system, it doesn't matter the time frame it represents. It's tied back to these underlying mathematical principles, Fibonacci, prime numbers to ensure it's not just an average, but a true reflection of the market's underlying momentum and balance point. So Cinell isn't just swapping one average for another number. He's completely redefining how we perceive and crucially measure market movement. How then does he refine this idea of a trading line to capture more of those big moves and importantly, manage risk more effectively, moving from that langing observation to something more more responsive? Exactly. That's the core of it. Cinell's refinement is deeply rooted in mathematical principles, particularly as you mentioned the Fibonacci sequence, those numbers we see everywhere. One, one, two, three, five, eight, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, and so on. It's also prime numbers. He emphasizes that while a simple moving average can look like a trend line on your chart, visually, yeah. The actual trend, remember, is precisely defined by the slope. The slope of current price compared to a historical place over a specific, mathematically significant period. And this distinction trend, as quantifiable slope versus trend line as just a visual representation, it's crucial. Why is that distinction so vital? Because a visual trend line, like a simple moving average, might appear to hold steady. And if the underlying mathematical slope has already flattened out or even reversed, you can be walking into a track. Precisely. You could be entering on a full signal or worse, staying in a losing trade far too long, because the line hasn't visually crossed yet, even though the momentum died ages ago. Okay. So how does he make it precise? You mentioned specific numbers. Yeah. To give you an idea of his precision in his system, a one-day trend for 4x specifically is approximated as 27 hours. 27 hours at 24. No, meticulously calibrated, he says, for the specific 245 market hours and liquidity flows of foreign exchange. Building on that, a two-day trend is roughly 54 hours. Now, instead of using simple moving averages based on these periods, Sunail integrates components from the Ichimoku Kinko-hio system. Ichimoku, right? A cloud chart. Exactly. Components like the Kajunsen often called the standard line or equilibrium line, and the Chikusban, that lagging span, that plots current price back in time. He uses these to define his precise trading lines and to monitor the actual, cornifiable trends or slopes. Let's get specific then, really nail this down. How does something like a 36-day Kijunsen fit into this framework? And how is it fundamentally different from a traditional 50-day moving average, beyond just, you know, 36 versus 50? Okay. This is truly a core distinction, Sunail makes. It's critical to understand if you're exploring a system. A 50-day moving average is, like we said, a general calculation. Average price over 50 periods. It's popular no doubt. You pick with us almost. Yeah. And chapter 26 introduces it as a common strategy. Sunail acknowledges it, calls it an excellent trade line, even an additional anchor. But he immediately stresses his limitations when used in isolation. Why? Because it lacks that mathematical underpinning. Precisely. It lacks the underpinning and the systemic integration that his own tools provide. Now, compare that to the 36-day Kijunsen. This isn't just another average, not a standalone line you slap on a chart. It's an integral component of his comprehensive Ichimoku-based system. Yeah. Specifically, he often refers to the two-benned 16-period Kijunsen on an age four chart. That's a four-hour chart popular with swing traders. Now this 216-period setting on the age four, based on his precise 27-hour daily approximation, while it works out to roughly equate to 36 calendar days. Ah, so that's where 36 comes from. It's derived. And crucially, its calculation is different. It's the midpoint of the highest, high, and lowest low over that 216-period lookback, not just an average of closing prices. It's the midpoint of the range, okay, huh? Right. This makes it a naturally very stable support or resistance level, like a dynamic equilibrium point for that time frame. So Nail identifies it as reflecting the primary monthly trend, and calls it a very stable long-term trading line within his method. It's robust because it considers the price extremes, not just where price happened close. And that makes sense. So it's less susceptible to maybe one noisy close price. Exactly. Now, furthermore, Sennail also employs a specific 54-day exponential moving average, or EMA, within his system. Again, 54 isn't just plucked from thin air. Fibonacci-related. Yes, it's derived from Fibonacci primes, like two and three, which he scales up from his two-day, 54-hour, and three-day trend concepts to create longer-term signals. But here's the really critical part. This 54-day EMA is always used in conjunction with his two-day ChicoSPAN for trend confirmation. Okay, the ChicoSPAN again. How does that confirm the EMA signal? The ChicoSPAN, remember, plots the current closing price back 26 periods. So Sennail looks to see if the ChicoSPAN, representing current price projected into the past, is clearly above or below the price action from 26 periods ago, and if it aligns with the signal from the 54-day EMA. Ah, so it's like a filter. Price crosses the 54 EMA, but is the underlying trend confirmed by ChicoSPAN being free and clear in the direction of the trade? You got it. It's a check. Is the momentum really there? The synergistic combination, the mathematically derived EMA plus the ChicoSPAN confirmation, that's where his system's effectiveness really lies. It's designed specifically to avoid that criminal waste by providing much more precise entry and exit signals. So the fundamental difference is... Huge, really. It's profound. The 50-day EMA is a common general strategy. It can work sometimes, but it's inherently prone to significant lag and false signals because it's just an average. In contrast, the 36-toe Chinsen and Sunials Refined 54-day EMA are precise trading lines designed as integral parts of a whole system. Right. A system that considers underlying true trends via ChicoSPAN is... Fibonacci numbers, prime numbers, and crucially robust risk management built around these precise levels. They don't just tell you what happened. They help you understand why it might be happening and where the market's true equilibrium or momentum might be. That is a powerful distinction, moving from just watching a line wiggle to understanding the engine behind the price movement. So Sunel uses these derived tools, the 54-day EMA, the 36-day Chichon Sen as robust anchors. But you said it's a system. It can't just be lines on a chart. What other layers of analysis does he bring in to make these strategies truly effective and avoid that criminal waste? Absolutely. It's a multi-layered approach. You need more than just the lines. So what else is in the toolkit? Okay. First, as we just discussed, there's that trend confirmation with ChicoSPAN. It's not optional. It's integral. When trading is 54-day EMA, for example, he insists on using that two-day ChicoSPAN to confirm the underlying trend right at that moment. So it prevents jumping the gun on false signals? Exactly. It's like a built-in filter. If price crosses the 54-EMA, great. But if the ChicoSPAN is stuck in traffic, hitting past price levels, that's a major warning sign. It prevents you from getting chopped up by false breakouts or whipsaws. It's almost like a lie detector for the price signal. I like that analogy. A lie detector. What else? Next up, Sunel incorporates wave counting. This adds a really powerful predictive element to the mix. Ah, like, elite wave. Or something different. It's his own specific application tied into his timeframes. By counting, say, daily waves within the context of five-day structures, which are themselves nested within these larger 54-day structures. Layers within layers. Right. Traders gain incredibly valuable clues about the maturity of a trend. Is it likely to continue or is it maybe getting exhausted? How does counting waves tell you that? Well, it helps determine if a trend structure is an impulse that's typically moving with the main trend, usually showing five or more distinct waves, signaling strength, and likely continuation. Or if it's a correction. Okay. A correction being. A move against the main trend. These usually unfold in just one or three waves, typically signaling a temporary pause or maybe the start of a larger reversal. Understanding whether you're in wave three of an impulse versus wave C of a correction gives you huge insights into when to enter, when to potentially add to a winning position, or crucially when to get out before a major reversal takes back your gains. So it adds context and timing to the signals from the Cajuncin or EMA. Precisely. And finally, and you could argue this is the most important piece. Let me guess. Risk management. You got it. Robust risk management. The ultimate goal, as Suniel states so emphatically, is to win big, lose small consistently. Easier said than done for most traders. Well, he argues it's a direct outcome of his system's precision. It's not just a mantra. It involves setting stops at levels that are least likely to be hit, specifically identified by these mathematically derived trading lines, like the Cajuncin or key Fibonacci retracement levels within his framework. So the lines aren't just for entry, they define your risk points too. Absolutely. And you only take trades when the price action clearly aligns with the desired trend and offers a favorable setup according to the system rules. Suniel emphasizes that his Fibonacci derived trading lines inherently provide excellent reward to risk ratio because they often identify entry points very close to potential turning points. This allows for relatively tight stops compared to the potential profit targets. Which is the holy grail, really. Low risk, high potential reward. That's the aim. This systematic approach is designed to transform trading from, you know, an educated gas based on a ligand line into a much more calculated edge. Wow. Okay, this deep dive has really, really shown us that while popular tools like the 50-day, the 200-day moving average, they offer a starting point, maybe a general compass. Mm-hmm. A starting point. The same mastery in trading, at least as Suniel demonstrates it, seems to come from refining these concepts with a much deeper systemic understanding. It's about combining maybe traditional wisdom with these innovative, mathematically grounded techniques. The Kijunsen, precisely calibrated EMAs, strategic wave counting that trading lie detector test we talked about. Exactly. And if you connect this to the bigger picture, it really highlights how any complex system, whether it's finance or engineering or even, I don't know, biology, it benefits hugely from understanding not just what seems to work on the surface, but why it works at a fundamental level and how to adapt and integrate different components to get truly robust, maybe even predictable results. Suniel's approach really does seem to transform a simple, visual approximation, the moving average, into a powerful component of a disciplined, proactive trading methodology, one that's designed fundamentally to minimize losses and maximize profit capture. So thinking about this discussion, what stands out most to you? How might adopting a more detailed, maybe more fistomatized approach to identifying actual trends, those slopes, versus just watching visual trading lines? How might that change your own perspective on analyzing the market? That's a great question for everyone listening to consider. If clear, there's a world of precision potentially available beyond what those standard indicators offer on their own. Now if you're looking to truly master these concepts and really delve into the specific details of Suniel's charts, his methodologies, because let's be honest, we've only scratched the surface today. Oh, definitely, there's so much more detail in the book. We highly recommend getting a copy of his book, a practical system for trading for an exchange. It's packed with precise examples, charts, walkthroughs, insights that go far, far beyond what we could possibly cover here in our deep dive. Absolutely. If this sparked your interest, the book is where you'll find the full blueprint.
