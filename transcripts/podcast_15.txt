 Welcome to the Deep Dive. We're your shortcut to getting genuinely well informed. We take the most interesting stuff you send our way, articles, research insights cut through all the noise and boil it down into something clear, actionable, real understanding. We're diving into something pretty specific but really fascinating. The strategic world of forex scalping. We're looking at a very precise system for, well, aiming for consistent quick profits. Using chapter 21 from a really groundbreaking book as our guide, it's all about using those tiny market moves to build up gains over time. That's right. Our main source here is a practical system for trading forex by Sunel Kuchal. Sunel, he's got like 22 years of real trading experience and he's built this unique method that kind of blends each moku charting which we can touch on with other solid principles. It's all aimed at financial independence. Just briefly, it's this Japanese system very visual helps follow trends because you hold picture at once. But our mission today, it's really focused. Let's unpack Sunel's specific way of doing these quick profitable trades. Scalping basically. Okay, scalping. Before we jump into chapter 21 specifics, maybe just quickly define scalping for anyone who might be new to that term. What does it actually mean in trading? Sure. Scalping is, it's a style of trading, very high frequency. The whole idea is to grab lots of small profits from really quick short term trades. So instead of waiting for a big market move, you're capitalizing on the little ups and downs, the smaller price shifts that happen all the time within the bigger trend. Think lots of small bites, not one huge meal. Got it. High frequency, small bites, quick trades makes sense. Okay, so let's dig into chapter 21 then. Sunel lays out this low risk system for scalping. And the core idea seems to be this thing he calls the Ichiban 216 for 54 hours on an M15 chart. That sounds very specific. What exactly is that? And why is it so central? It is super specific. And that's kind of the point of his precision. So that Ichiban 216 phrase, it refers to using a 216 period kajensen line on a 15 minute chart. Let's break that down. The kajensen or baseline. So that's the standard part of the Ichimoku system. Think of it like a moving average, but calculated slightly differently. It's the midpoint price over a set period. In this case, 216 periods. And the M15 chart just means each bar or candle you see represents 15 minutes of trading. Okay, 216 periods on a 15 minute chart. Right. And the reason for 216 is that he uses it to track a two day trend. Now his definition of a trading day is a bit unique. He uses 27 hours. So two of those days gives you 54 hours. And 216 periods on an M15 chart captures exactly that 54 hour or two day timeframe. Interesting definition of a day, but why 216 periods? Why not just, you know, round it to 200 like a lot of standard moving averages. Is there something special about 216? Yeah, exactly. It's not just a random number. Senao found through his own observation and testing that 216 seemed to create a more harmonic or stable structure compared to the typical 200. He connects this two ideas from people like WD Gan who looked at geometry and specific number relationships and markets. The idea is that certain numbers might reveal underlying market structures. And 216 divides really nicely, you know, into quarters gives you 54 periods into eighths, gives you 27. It creates this very stable trade line that gives you a reliable perspective, helps filter out noise, which is crucial for scalp. Okay, so this 216 kj on the M15 is like our baseline, our stable reference point over two days. So if that's our guide, how does its boundary, its actual line on the chart help us set stop losses? Because for scalpers, managing risk precisely must be absolutely paramount, right? Absolutely critical. And this is where the system gets really practical about risk, that 216 period trade line on the M15 chart, that becomes the foundation for your risk management when scalping. You set your stop losses directly in relation to that line, but here's the specific detail. You reference the kj onsen's position where the trailing 13 hour Chikus fan currently sits. Okay, hold on, the Chikus fan, that's the lagging span, right? It shows the current price plotted back in time. Exactly. The Chikus fan or lagging span, it plots the current closing price, but shifted back 26 periods by default in standard each mochi. But here, Senail is referencing its position relative to the price action 13 hours ago, specifically in relation to the two day kj onsen line. Using that specific trailing point, the 13 hour point relative to the two day kj onsen gives you a dynamic trend aware spot for your stop loss. There's not just a fixed number of pips away, it's anchored to the recent relevant price action defined by this 13 hour look back against the two day line. Wow. Okay, that's layered. You've got the two day trend line, and then you're using a 13 hour look back point on the Chikus fan relative to that line to such a risk, very precise. So this is where it gets really interesting, I think. How do the actual scalping trays, the quick entries and exits use this two day line? How does it integrate with that shorter term 13 hour Chikus fan signal? Right, this is the core of the entry strategy. Senail really emphasizes that 13 hour trend, visualized through the Chikus fan's relationship with price 13 hours ago as the anchor for the actual scalping decision. He sees that 13 hour time frame as a kind of sweet spot. It's short enough to catch those quick turns needed for scalping, but long enough to filter out some of the really chaotic noise you might get on say a one minute chart. It helps identify optimal turning points, like finding the crest of a small wave within the larger tide. That's a great way to put it. He actually uses an analogy of a diver doing a jackknife that curled up point just before they straighten out as the point of least risk. The 13 hour trend turning point is kind of like that, an optimal lower risk moment to act. But here's the critical part, the combination. For the system to be stable, any potential trade signal like price crossing above the two day cajonson, the 216 line, must be confirmed. And the confirmation comes from the 13 hour Chikus fan also being above that same two day cajonson line, same for selling. Price crosses below the cajonson, and the 13 hour Chikus also below it. Ah, so it's a dual confirmation. The price itself needs to cross the main two day line, and the short term momentum indicator of the 13 hour Chikus has to agree relative to that same line that prevents jumping again maybe. Exactly. And sure, your short term scalp is aligned with the direction indicated by that slightly longer two day perspective defined by the 216 cajonson. It provides stability. So while a scalper might technically execute on a lower time frame, maybe an M5 chart, Sunal prefers viewing this whole setup, especially that 216 channel on the M15 chart. The key is that the scalps, the actual trades are always controlled by the risk parameter set by that two day trading line, and always taken in the direction that line is pointing. You're using the short term signals to enter, but only when they align with the bigger two day flow. Okay, that paints a very clear picture. Highly structured, disciplined, almost mechanical in a good way, which leads to the big question for you, the listener, what's the payoff, what's the actual profit goals Sunal sets for the system? Right, the objective. If you look at the bigger pictures Sunal presents, the goal is ambitious, but clear. He aims to generate a consistent 1% to 2% profit on the trading account each week. His reasoning is that within a typical five day trading week, based on his 27 hour day cycle, there are usually around 10 distinct substructures or opportunities that fit the strategy. Plenty of chances to hit that weekly target without forcing trades or taking huge risks on any single one. One to 2%. Weekly. That compounds incredibly quickly, much faster than traditional investments, which naturally makes you think about sustainability. That realistic week after week. What are the core risk rules needed to even attempt that? That's the crucial part, managing the risk to make it sustainable. Sunal is very clear. Success isn't about winning every trade. It's about making sure your winning trades are generally larger than your losing trades, a positive wind-out loss ratio in terms of profit. And the rules are strict. First, never, ever risk more than 2% of your total account equity on any single trade. That keeps losses manageable. Second, keep your overall leverage low. We recommend staying below 25x to 30x your account equity. This prevents overexposure if the market moves sharply against you. So, small risk per trade control overall leverage? Precisely. And fundamentally, trade only in the direction of the main trend, which in this context is defined by that two-day kjensen line. You're looking to buy the dips in an uptrend or sell the rallies in a downtrend using the 13-hour confirmation we discussed. It really boils down to patience. Wait for the price action to confirm your setup according to the rules. If you jump in early, don't trade based on gut feeling, follow the system. That disciplined execution is key to trying to achieve that consistency. Okay, so wrapping this up for you, our listener. What's the takeaway here? Today, we've really dug into Sunel Kuchels' very precise scalping strategy from chapter 21. We saw how that specific Ichiban 216 on a 15-minute chart the two-day kjensen acts as the bedrock for risk management, defining those critical stop loss points using that clever 13-hour shikku reference. And we explored how you combine that stable two-day line with the shorter term 13-hour shikku signal to find confirmed entry points for quick scouts, always making sure you're trading with that underlying two-day flow. Yeah, it's a really compelling look at how applying technical indicators like Ichimoku in a very structured, disciplined way can potentially give traders a clear plan. A plan with defined risk, a specific profit goal, and a method for navigating those fast moving forex markets. It's about precision and process. Absolutely. Which brings us to our final provocative thought for you to consider. We've talked a lot about precision entries, defined risk, and aiming for consistent small gains in the scalping context. So how might taking a similarly disciplined, incremental approach, focusing on small, consistent steps with clear rules, and manage risk? How might that transform other areas of your life where you're looking for steady long-term growth? Something to think about.
