 Welcome to The Deep Dive. Your shortcut to being genuinely well informed. Today we're tackling something pretty exciting for anyone interested in financial independence, the world of forex trading. Indeed. A very dynamic space. Absolutely. And we're not just scratching the surface, we're doing a deep dive into Sunil Kuchil's book, A Practical System for Trading Forex. Okay. Let's unpack this. So our mission today, it's really clear. We're focusing right in on chapter 27. This is where Sunil or SK lays out what he calls his, well, his ultimate preferred strategy. The culmination, really. Exactly. The culmination of his whole system and it's all geared towards consistently making get this 1% to 2% profit every single week. Yeah, that's the core promise. So we're digging into what makes this final strategy tick, what's new, what's pivotal here. Right. And what's really fascinating about this and SK really hammers this home is the power of consistently earning that 1% to 2% weekly. It's quite different from standard investment. Exactly. Well, it's not your typical buy and hold equity approach. The key thing SK emphasizes is prioritizing regular capital turnover. So instead of waiting, you know, maybe months for a significant move. Right. Like in stock sometimes. Exactly. You're aiming to constantly recycle your capital. He argues pretty convincingly, I think, that this grows your account balance much faster and more reliably than waiting for those big long term wins. It's all about compounding those smaller frequent gains. That idea prioritizing capital turnover, that's a big mental shift for a lot of people I'd imagine. It should really speed things up. But Forex also means leverage, right? And that can be tricky. Oh, definitely. A double edge sword for sure. So how does SK handle that? How do you manage that risk while still shooting for those weekly targets? That's, yeah, that's a super important point. And it really shows how disciplined his approach is. So, you know, traders often get access to quite high leverage, maybe 30X, sometimes even more. But SK recommends being very specific. He advises, you know, resisting the urge to use more than say 25X to 30X, your total account equity, period. Okay. So a cap. A hard cap. But here's where the strategy gets really interesting. Of that total leverage you do use only a small piece, he says, no more than 5X should go towards those longer term strategies. Okay. Like a big trends. Yeah. Exactly. Like trades based on the slower 50 day or maybe the 200 day trends, the big picture stuff. Gotcha. So, that's the significant remainder of your leverage. That's where the monthly profit engine really lies. That capital gets put to work in medium term strategies. Specifically, he centers these around what he calls the nine day or the five day trading lines. Uh huh. This careful leverage management. It's like fundamental to his whole system. It's about having enough power for the quicker trades without, you know, putting yourself way out on a limb with the slower ones. It's very strategic, capable deployment. So it's not just if you use leverage, but how you allocate it. Very smart. And for those medium term strategies, you mentioned he introduces this concept of nested trading lines. Sounds complex, almost like a, um, a market GPS. That's a great way to put it. A market GPS. It starts broad, daily view and drills right down. Yeah. That's where it gets really interesting, I think. How does he build this layered view? Can you walk us through it? Absolutely. This nesting idea, it's really SK's way of bringing, uh, precision to what can feel like, well, chaos sometimes, right? Definitely. If we connect this to the bigger picture, um, it's about understanding that price doesn't just move randomly. It moves within these structured timeframes that are all linked together. So he starts with the 216 period daily structure. That's the long term anchor 216 days. Okay. Yeah, he thinks of it like an annual trading line. It's roughly nine months of actual trading days in a year, you know, accounting for weekends holidays. Right. Makes sense. Now, what's fascinating is how systematically he breaks this down. That big 216 day line, he splits it into four distinct quarters. Each quarter is 54 periods or 54 trading days. Okay. So 216 divided by four is 54. Exactly. But he doesn't stop there. Inside that 54 day structure, he finds even smaller, more, um, actionable subsets, like the 13.5 day structure. 13.5, that's specific. Very. It's exactly one quarter of the 54 day period. And he often tracks this using a 324 period EMA that's an exponential moving average on an H1 or one hour chart that EMA gives more weight to recent prices so it reacts faster. Okay. So we're slicing these larger cycles into smaller and smaller pieces, more precise. And this eventually gets us to the nine day structure you mentioned earlier. Precisely. Yeah. He subsets. It makes up about 15% of that 54 day period. And this one is often tracked using a nine day kajmsum. Kajmsum. That's part of the H1 moku system, right? That's right. It basically shows the midpoint of the high and low over that nine day period because you could sense the trend in momentum. And he also highlights a 27 period structure. He sees that as a key proxy for a single trading day. You get that by dividing the 216 daily periods by eight. Wow. Okay. So these numbers, 216, 54, 13.5, nine, 27. Yeah. Which is random. Not at all. And SK points out how they align with natural patterns. You can add them to Fibonacci sequences. You know, one, two, three, five, eight. Oh, Fibonacci, right? Yeah. Where that eight day sequence helps spot minor trends, which then kind of leads naturally into the nine day line as the next important level. And they also relate to prime numbers, like two and three. And their squares, four and nine. It reinforces this idea of inherent market cycles. It's quite mathematical. It really shows the level of precision he's aiming for. It really does. And he takes this right down to the hourly level too, which is crucial if you're actively trading. So for example, two days is 54 hours on an H1 chart. Okay. Four days is 108 hours and nine days is 216 hours. Again, on that H1 chart. This gives you a really clear hourly map for super precise trading. You can see how those bigger daily moves are actually unfolding hour by hour. That layered thinking, that structured approach, that's the TPS you mentioned. Exactly. And let's traders pin points, specific entry. And maybe more importantly, exit points with layers of confirmation. Okay. It's clear this nesting is like the foundation. But let's bring it back to the listener aiming for that 1% to 2% a week. How do all these lines actually guide their decisions day to day? Which one is the most critical signal for hitting that weekly goal? Right. That's the million dollar question, isn't it? Very correct. And chapter 27 gives a clear answer. It's the nine day line. The nine day. Okay. SK really elaborates on why the nine day k-gents. And especially when you combine it with that 13.5 day EMA we mentioned. Why that combination is his preferred method specifically for booking profits within that bigger 54 day structure. How does he explain that? Why those two? He uses this really great analogy. I mentioned dropping a ball from say 54 story building. As it falls, you can't know for sure exactly which floor is the absolute bottom, right? Yeah. But the nine day k-gents and then the 13.5 day EMA, they reliably mark out the lowest 15% to 25% of that whole 54 day high low range. Ah, I see. So a high probability zone near the bottom. Exactly. Which makes it in his words an excellent place to book profits. Especially for trades you might have entered higher up, maybe near the 54 day moving average. It's about locking in games at a really opportune moment, not necessarily the absolute peak or trough. That analogy really helps clarify it. It's about finding that sweet spot for taking profits, not guessing the exact turning point. Precisely. It functions as the ideal take profit level, just as prices start showing signs of reversing. An SK connects this to how Fivonacci patterns unwinds. You often see a two day reversal first, then maybe a three day, then a five day or weekly reversal. Those smaller time frames signal the bigger move. Interesting connection. So he emphasizes that this nine day trend line strategy offers, and I quote, one of the most stable and the most profitable methods for making 1% for the week consistently without taking on too much risk. Consistent weekly profits, low risk. I mean, that's the dream for traders, isn't it? But Forex is volatile. Some might hear that and think it sounds, I don't know, too reason, or maybe like a certain forget kind of thing. Yeah, that's a valid concern. But SK is very clear. This is not certain forget its dynamic. It operates within that medium term context we discussed. What it does essentially is it doubles the safety margin compared to just watching a weekly line because it's anchored in those larger nested structures, the 54 day, the 216 day. So while you're using the nine day for profit taking, you're always aware of where it sits in the bigger picture. So context is key. Absolutely. It requires a holistic view. He stresses you need to look at the nine day line alongside other signals like the five day Donchin channel breakout. Donchin that shows highs and lows right for breakout. Exactly. Helps spot potential breakouts. Helps you need to consider the 36 day could Junson for a more complete picture. Okay. Some more layers of confirmation. Right. And SK even suggests tracking the nine day line using the Chikou span, another Hichimoku tool, said at a 36 hour or 54 hour lack. That helps confirm the trend direction by plotting current price back in time. It's all about stacking these confirmations to build a really high probability setup, which you know, raises an important practical question. For someone wanting to actually use this, how does all this precision translate into managing the actual trades day to day to get those consistent games? It's really quite incredible how SK has taken these complex inner woven time frames and indicators and distilled them into something so precise, so actionable, you know, from that big 216 day anchor, breaking it down systematically 54 day quarters, the 27 period daily proxy, and then homing in on that nine day could Junson for the consistent weekly profit. It really is a comprehensive system. It seems to offer a clear plan, right? A specific entry idea, maybe based on the larger structures, and then critically, a disciplined exit strategy using that nine day line. Absolutely. And honestly, this deep dive, we've really only scratched the surface of what Sunil Kuchau lays out of the book. He goes into much more detail, provides loads of examples, specific roles for applying this across different market conditions, different time frames. So there's a lot more detail in the book itself. Oh, definitely. To really get the full picture, all the nuance is the practical steps. We'd strongly encourage listeners to grab a copy of the book, a practical system for trading forex. It's an invaluable resource if you're serious about trading forex in a disciplined way. Indeed. And it really makes you think, doesn't it, whether you're trading forex or tackling any complex challenge, that power of a structured, methodical approach. This clear SK system comes from breaking down a huge problem into these manageable linked parts and then pinpointing the best places for action. That systematic thinking is key. It really is. So maybe something for you, the listener, to think about. How could you apply that kind of structured layered thinking to your own goals or decisions, even outside of trading? What complex problem are you trying to build a precise GPS for? Trying to mull over until our next deep dive.
