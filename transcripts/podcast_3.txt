 We've all heard the mantra in trading haven't we? The trend is your friend. It's practically etched into every beginner's guide to Forex. But honestly, what does that really mean in practice? Yeah, it sounds good. Right. We're trying to trend with real precision, measured strength, and most crucially, how do you write it without getting burned? It sounds deceptively simple, but I think the truth is most common approaches leave you guessing. And that guesswork is precisely what we're tackling today. It's a huge problem. Our deep dive takes us into Senil Kuchal's incredibly insightful book of practical system for trading Forex, calling him SK today. We're going to unpack key concepts mainly from chapter three, focusing entirely on SK's unique methodology. It's really about moving past those vague definitions to pinpoint trend direction and then with remarkable precision, identify your optimal entry and exit points. The goal here is to help you become a far more informed and ultimately maybe more discipline trader. So, our mission for this deep dive then is to cut through all that noise, pass the subjective interpretations and give you a clear actionable understanding of what a trend truly is in the Forex market. We're aiming for the kind of insights that genuinely make a difference when you're looking at those charts. Let's get into it. What's it do it? So, SK starts chapter three with this really powerful analogy, it immediately resonated with me. He asks you to imagine driving on a completely dark, unlit dirt road. You're crawling along, feeling nervous, maybe 27 kilometers an hour. Super slow. Yeah, and suddenly a guide car speeds past you at what he calls a smart clip. Say, double that, 54 kilometers an hour. What's your natural reaction? You breathe a sigh of relief, right? Definitely. You've got someone to follow. Exactly. You accelerate to follow, keeping a safe distance, not so far behind that you lose sight of them. That, SK explains, is the essence of trend following. You pick a reliable guide and you stay safely in its wake. And this analogy, it really highlights the core problem many traders face, doesn't it? Most people, when they talk about trends, they loosely define them using lagging indicators like say a 200 day moving average. You're a classic one, yeah. Right. But the Sinell calls this a crazy idea. His point is that a 4x pair doesn't respect your moving average, it just doesn't care about your calculation. It doesn't know it's there. Exactly. Which raises that important question. If not a moving average, what kind of measurement should we use? Simple. Exponential. Linear weight. Which one? The truth is, relying on these traditional averages often leaves you constantly second guessing, you know, is the trend really up or is it down now? It's like Sunail's other Vivid analogy. Yeah. The flying dragon. He says you wouldn't be foolish enough to sit directly in front of a fire breathing dragon's face. Definitely not. You sit on its knacker shoulder, right? Yeah. At a safe, respectful distance, because standing in its way, trading against the trend means you will get toasted, guaranteed. Guaranteed. It really underscores the danger, the almost guaranteed loss. If you don't have a precise, unambiguous definition of what the trend actually is, before you even think about placing a trade. That's the fundamental issue with moving averages when precision is your absolute goal. They became popular partly because while they were computationally feasible with early computers back in the mid 1930s, yet successful traders like WDGAN operated effectively long before them. They didn't need them. The problem is that moving averages, they just blur the exact entry and exit points. They leave you in this ambiguous zone. Unsure if a minor pullback is a real trend reversal or just, you know, noise. That hesitation can kill you. Absolutely. It leads to uncertain trades, often with these fleeting profits that quickly turn into losses. For consistent trading, getting a precise answer for when to enter an exit is absolutely vital. And moving averages simply don't provide that level of clarity. OK, so if moving averages are fundamentally flawed for this kind of precision, what does offer it? This is where it gets really interesting, I think, because Escai champions a completely different way of seeing the market. It's a geometric approach. It is. And what's truly fascinating here is how Sunnale defines that geometric approach. He's not just looking at numbers and isolation. He's looking at how price points relate visually on the chart. He creates these definitive angles and positions. And this distinct visual clarity leads him to a really powerful tool from the Ichimoku system called the Chikusban. Chikusban. OK. It's deceptively simple, really. It's just the current price plotted a specific number of periods behind on the chart. So it's not an average. No, not at all. It's genius lies in allowing you to directly compare the current price to a historical price at that exact same spot back in time. It gives you an immediate, unambiguous visual of the trend slope and direction, the direct comparison, pure geometry. And Sunnale uses yet another brilliant analogy here to help visualize this tool, water skiing. Ah, yes, the water skiing. Imagine your water skiing, right? Right. And you're being pulled by a boat, say, 27 meters ahead of you. That boat, which is your Chikusban in this analogy, is doing all the hard work navigating, avoiding obstacles like salo water or rocks. You simply follow along at that set distance, reacting to the boat's turns. That Chikusban works in the same way, pulling you along at a set distance from the market's true direction, allowing you to react clearly to its turns. Building right on that. Sunnale places significant emphasis on a specific timeframe. The 27-period trend on the 30-minute chart. He defines this as a 13-hour trend. Now 27-periods on a 30-minute chart is 13.5 hours. He just rounds it to 13. OK. 13 hours. So, it's a specific period. Well, this isn't just some random number SK pulled at a thin air. This 13-hour trend is what he identifies as the absolute smallest trend you should consider trading if you want to minimize your risk. Smallest but still reliable. Exactly. It's sort of the sweet spot where the market develops enough momentum to give you a reliable direction, but without exposing you to the extreme volatility of much shorter timeframes. It's where trend stability truly meets timely entry. It's a foundational insight for discipline risk management that really sets a system apart. That's precisely why it's so powerful then. For instance, if that 27-periods' shakuzpan on your 30-minute chart is visually sitting above the price from 27 periods ago, which represents that 13-hour look back you mentioned, then the trend is definitively up. There's no guessing involved, no subjective interpretation needed. It's a clear binary signal. Yes or no? Black and white. Which is invaluable when you're making split-second trading decisions. Absolutely. If you further enhance this precision and crucially to control risk, SK integrates Dauncheen channels into a system. Dauncheen channels, okay, what are those exactly? They're essentially lines, pretty straightforward, that highlight the highest high and the lowest low over a set period. So they create these upper and lower bands, and there's usually a midpoint line too. SK considers the 13-hour Dauncheen channel as one of the most important elements, specifically because it provides another precise tool for risk management alongside the Jekyll. Okay, and to truly grasp how these channels help control risk, Suna gives us another brilliant visual. The JackknifeDiver analogy. Ah, the diver, yes. Good idea. Think of a diver, right? Curling up midair just before they plunge into the water. At that moment, that curled-up position, the distance from their head to their toes, their overall range, is at its absolute smallest. Right, they're coiled up. Exactly. Curled-up position isn't just about finding a narrow price range, it's about identifying the moment of maximum coiled energy within that 13-hour Dauncheen channel. It's just before a significant directional move, either a reversal or a continuation. SK says it's the least risky point to take a trade. That narrow 13-hour Dauncheen range is crucial for managing risk. It gives the trend just enough room to breathe while minimizing potential losses if you're wrong. The crucial two-step process, really, that dramatically increases your probability of success. The trend, as identified by the Chikusbam, that's the first event you observe, tells you the underlying direction. Is it up or down? Step one. Step one. But it's then confirmed later by a Dauncheen channel breakout. That's step two. Ah, so it's a confirmation signal? Precisely. This two-stage confirmation helps you distinguish between a true significant market shift and just, you know, random market noise. Mm-hmm. It ensures you're entering with much higher conviction. Okay, with that foundation laid, understanding the trend geometrically, using Chikusbam and Dauncheen, let's turn our attention to the actual act of trading. Once you truly understand the trend and how to identify it, how do you actually trade it effectively? SK emphasizes that trends in Forex never, ever move in a straight line. No, they absolutely don't. They undulate. Right. They're comprised of smaller, these sort of wave-like movements. That's absolutely right. And he precisely defines these smaller movements. He calls them dips, which are temporary swing lows within an established uptrend. Okay. And rallies, which are temporary swing highs within an established down trend. Makes sense. And Sunil's advice here is incredibly clear, almost like a commandment. If that 13-hour trend is unequivocally up, you only buy on a dip, a natural temporary pullback within that upward momentum. Wait for it to come back to you. Exactly. You never chase a rising price. Similarly, if the 13-hour trend is down, you only sell on a rally when the price bounces up temporarily. It's about waiting for the market to offer you a better, lower risk entry point within the established trend direction. You use the trend's natural waves to your advantage and always, always trade in the direction of that main 13-hour trend. Never trade against it. Okay. Crystal clear. So what does this mean for those even smaller trends you might see flashing on shorter time frames? Good question. It's not about how many times how movements like say nine-hour or even three-hour trends are considered minor scalping opportunities, little quick trades. But here's the absolute critical point he makes, right? These smaller scalping opportunities must be nested within or perfectly aligned with that larger dominant 13-hour trend. Absolutely crucial. He says you should never trade against the 13-hour trend, not even for those short-term scalping opportunities. It's all about ensuring your smaller plays are always riding the bigger wave of the dominant market direction. You got it. And to facilitate this crucial layered approach, SK actually provides specific, duncey and channel settings for these different time frames. For instance, as we said, he suggests using 27 periods on a 30-minute chart for that key 13-hour turning point. Then, you'd use smaller duncey and settings for your short-term scalps, but always making sure they consistently align with that dominant 13-hour trend direction indicated by the Chaku. This layered strategy is really key to ensuring your smaller, quicker trades are always supported by the broader market direction. It helps significantly minimize your risk and hopefully maximize your consistency. It's like having the wind at your back, even for the small moves. That's a great way to put it. So if we connect all of this to the bigger picture, what Snail's approach really provides is this precise geometric framework for truly understanding and confidently trading trends in Forex. By moving beyond those traditional, often lagging indicators like simple moving averages, which cause so much confusion. Right. And instead leveraging tools like the Chaku span and those invaluable Donkey and Tannels, you gain a remarkably clear, much less ambiguous view of market direction. And this clarity allows for far more precise entries and exits and crucially much better risk management, especially with that strategic use of the 13-hour trend as your primary guide. So without seeing the market not as just a chaotic blur, but as a clear unfolding geometric pattern. So we've discussed these incredibly precise external tools for market analysis, charts, indicators. But Snail argues that true mastery isn't just about reading charts. It's also profoundly about reading yourself. Mm-hmm, self-awareness. Yeah. That's where he introduces your second friend in trading, right after the trend itself, your trading diary. And he means more than just a log of trades, doesn't it? I wish more. Detailed, brutally honest record of every mistake you make, every single deviation from your own trading rules. It's a comprehensive, unfiltered record of your trading personality, as he calls it. Knowing your weaknesses, your traders. Exactly. Knowing yourself, understanding your own tendencies and biases, SK says that's truly the indispensable first step to becoming a consistently good trader. You can't fix what you don't acknowledge. Absolutely. And look, to truly master these techniques, to really see the power of these systems and action, with all the charts and detailed examples that have been at all to life, Sunil Kuchel's book, A Practical System for Trading Forex, is really an invaluable resource. We highly recommend you get your copy if this approach resonates. Definitely sounds like essential reading if you want that precision. While that brings us to the end of this deep dive, until next time, keep learning, keep questioning, and keep deep diving into the knowledge that empowers you to navigate the markets with confidence.
