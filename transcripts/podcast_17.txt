 Today we're diving deep, really deep into the intricate world of forex trading. We'll be guided by the insights of Sunel, who's a season pro, you know, over two decades of experience navigating these often volatile markets. Our mission here for this deep dive is basically to give you a practical shortcut. A way to understand a system that's designed for financial independence, but crucially, without demanding your glued to the screen 24-7. It's not about chasing every single pip. It's more about making informed decisions with, well, clarity. We've got some great sources here, mainly excerpts from Sunel's book, A Practical System for Trading Foreign Exchange. It's quite insightful. And through this deep dive, we want to shed light on his unique approach at this interesting mix of Elliott Wave, WD Gam Principles, and Ichimoku Charding. Now, this isn't just theory, right? It's a system that's actually proven itself, shown real resilience, even through crazy market times, like the pandemic situation back in 2020, the aim. Consistent double-digit annual returns. So we'll really zoom in on the core indicators he uses on an M3 chart. That's a 30-minute chart. And we'll look at how he uses those indicators to keep a long-term perspective, which is vital. And we'll bring it all together with some real-world trading examples. Yeah. And what's really interesting about Sunel's story, his journey, is how it all started. It was actually sparked by a, shall we say, very expensive personal lesson he learned about currency movements way back in 2002. But that setback, it wasn't really a setback. It was the catalyst. It pushed him to develop this system. This really built on discipline and super careful risk management. He figured out early on that just relying on one indicator. It's like driving your car looking only in the review mirror. It doesn't work. So his approach is really comprehensive. It's more like your car's whole dashboard. You've got the brakes, steering mirrors, maybe even GPS all working together in concert. We're talking about getting the knowledge you need quickly, spotting those moments where it just clicks those aha moments, and really importantly, avoiding that feeling of being totally swamped by information. That happens a lot in trading. That's a great way to put it at the car analogy. So Sunel really focuses on the M3 chart. That's his core is a sweet spot, as he calls it, for finding good trading setups. But it's not just about the timeframe itself. It's about having the right tools for that timeframe. So, okay, let's get a quick overview, a snapshot of the essential indicators he puts on his M30 chart. What forms the backbone of his analysis there? Right. On that M30 chart, Sunel brings together a pretty powerful set of indicators. Each one has a specific job. He starts with the Tomoku. The settings are 12, 27, 216. This gives him that fundamental cloud structure. It offers the primary view on trend direction plus the port and resistance levels. But importantly, he doesn't just stop with one each Moku. He actually layers it. He adds a second each Moku. This one's set to 54, 54, 54. It shows up in magenta on his charts. For this one, he specifically watches its case and in Chikus fan lines to track the 27 hour daily trend line. Then for an even wider view, there's a third each Moku. This one's red. He's 216, 216, 216. Again, he's focusing on the case in a Chikus fan from this one, which gives him a direct measure of the 4.5 day trend. This multi-layered each Moku set up, it gives him incredible depth just from that one type of indicator. Wow. Okay. Layering each Moku like that. That sounds really insightful. He's building this deep multi-time frame picture just using different each Moku settings. What else is in his M30 toolkit? Well, moving beyond each Moku, he also brings in the parabolic SAR. The settings are 0.003, 0.012, and it's displayed in magenta. Interestingly, while it can show trend direction, Sunil mainly uses it as a dynamic tool for managing his stop losses. It lets them trail the market effectively as the price moves. Then for momentum, he uses Williams-Persar, with a setting of 13, shown in yellow. This is really good for spotting short-term extremes like overbought or oversold conditions, help some time entries on dips or rallies, and naturally the good old Mads D's in their two as standard settings, 12, 26, 9. He's really clear about this. It's never used on its own. It's more of a confirmation signal, not the primary reason to take a trade. Got it. So those are more for confirmation, kind of validating what the core each Moku layers are suggesting. Are there any other, maybe, visual aids or longer-term elements he pulls onto the M30 chart as well? Yes, absolutely. To really round out the system, he also uses Donchean channels. Specifically, he looks at the 243-period channel on the M30. This gives him a really valuable five-day perspective on price boundaries and volatility. And then finally, there's a series of exponential moving averages, the EMAs. And these are based on the Fibonacci sequence, which is interesting. You've got two, three, five, eight periods in blue, then a 13-period, E-mail, yellow, 21 and 34 in orange, and a 54-period, E-mail in red. These EMAs just provide a very clear, fluid visual of the actual trend movements across different short-to-medium time frames. They act like dynamic support and resistance lines. You put all these together, the layer, the Chimoku, the Tsar, Williams-Prasar, M-A-K-D, Donchean, the Fibonacci EMAs. They're not just random lines. They're like integrated lenses all focused on that M30 chart. Each one confirms or maybe challenges the others aiming for a high-confidence signal. That is a remarkably complete set of tools all focused on that M30 chart. But like you mentioned earlier, it's about more than just the immediate moment, right? So how does all this M30 analysis fit into the bigger picture? How do these indicators help you keep your eyes on the horizon and maintain that crucial long-term perspective for consistent trading success? Right, connecting into the bigger picture, maintaining that long-term view is, well, absolutely critical. It's all about putting those daily wiggles and jiggles into proper context. So now, it really emphasizes weekly preparation. He suggests having a specific weekly routine using what he calls a risk management dashboard. The idea is to get a really holistic view of the market before the trading week even starts. This isn't just a quick look either. For example, he uses a daily chart. And on that, he puts an itchamoku with settings 5, 9, 36. This is purely to confirm the broader underlying trend. The color and shape of that daily itchamoku cloud are super important. If it's, say, a thick red bearish cloud, that's a strong signal. Stay short. Doesn't matter if you see minor rallies on the M30. And that cloud, in his system, it's like this multi-dimensional view of support and resistance. If the price ever gets inside the cloud, that's a no-trend zone, a period of confusion. He advises just standing aside them. So this bigger daily and weekly view really stops you from getting chopped up by the short-term market noise. Hmm. That sounds like a really smart filter. A way to avoid getting sucked into the minute by minute stuff. And he uses Fibonacci for that long view, too, right, to help spot potential turning points. Precisely. Sunele uses the standard Fibonacci retracement levels, you know, 23.6%, 38.2%, 51.8%, 78.6%, he uses them to find potential turning points at what he calls invisible levels. These are price points that often act like magnets or support resistance, but they aren't always obvious just by looking at standard char patterns. He gave this really compelling example about the Australian dollar, the AUD. They had a big fall. They retraced upwards, but only to the 38.2% level. Now, that shallow retracement, it suggested there was probably more downside coming. And interestingly, this lined up perfectly with his Elliott Wave analysis, which was predicting a strong wave 3 continuation downwards. So it raises a really good question for any trader listening. How does your current trading fit in with these bigger market cycles? Are you aware of these invisible Fibonacci levels that might be guiding price? And it really does go beyond just the currencies themselves, doesn't it? He connects these Forex signals to wider investment thinking across different types of assets. Yes, absolutely. So NIO points out that the big annual trends in Forex, especially those involving the US dollar, can give you really vital clues about what might happen in the stock market, or just general market sentiment. For instance, if you see the US dollar strengthening significantly over time, that often means investors globally are selling other things, maybe stocks, commodities, other currencies, and converting back into US dollars. They might be seeking safety, or anticipating an economic slowdown. So this can apply a general weakness across other currencies, yes, but also potentially across equity markets around the world. So doing that careful, weekly perspective work grounded in what the Forex market is doing, it helps ground your daily trading decisions within that bigger market sentiment. It helps you trade with the main forces, not fight against them. And it can even inform decisions in your broader investment portfolio. Okay, the theory sounds solid, but seeing it work in practice, that's what really makes it click. So NIO gives some really clear live trading examples in his book. He walks us right through his decision process, how he sets stops, takes profits, manages the trade, starting with just a hypothetical $1,000 account. It really feels like you're looking over his shoulder during a live session, understanding the why behind every single move, not just the what. Yeah, those examples are gold because they show the practical side, the discipline application of all these indicators, and the risk rules. Let's look at trade, hashtag one. Interestingly, this one actually ended up being a small loss, but a very well-managed one just $1.60. So on April 1, 2025, Sinal starts, as always, by checking the daily chart for the big picture trend. He saw that the Chico span 36D and the 36D case in those are from his long-term daily and Shimoku settings, were both clearly below the price. That confirmed a strong 36-day short trend, solid signal. And this was backed up by the SDC, the Superdonting Channel, for five days, shown in orange, that also showed a weekly breakout downwards, lining up perfectly with that longer 36-day trend. Everything was pointing short. Okay, so all the big signals were screaming short, what stopped him from just jumping in? There must have been some kind of conflict on the shorter timeframe, right? Exactly right. And this is where the system's focus on confluence, getting agreement across timeframes, really comes into play. The immediate picture, the 13-hour breakout on AM30 chart, that was actually moving up. The Chico span 27, that's the white one, was above the price bars on the AM30. So you had this conflict. Strong, long-term bearish signals from multiple M30 indicators to the main HMokunai 27-16 cloud was bearish. The Ritch-Cuzpan 108 confirmed downward momentum, but the very immediate short-term was rallying. So the decision, most to stand aside, just wait, let that short-term rally play out and exhaust itself before even thinking about placing a short trade. And this discipline patience, even though it led to a tiny loss eventually by waiting, it really highlights Sunil's core idea. If you're ever in doubt, sometimes the best trade is simply no trade at all. Risk management isn't just about where you put your stop, it's also about avoiding if he's set-ups in the first place. That's such a key lesson in patience, isn't it? And then you have trade hashtag 4, which really shows how that patience, that waiting, and adjusting can turn things around into a profit. It demonstrates the power of that discipline method. Exactly. In trade hashtag 4, Sunil shows a classic strategy for getting into a concerned downtrend. Instead of chasing the price lower, he waited for a rally to get a better entry point for a short position. So the goal was clear, place a short trade. He describes getting into a 30-60 trade, meaning aligned with a 36-day trend, at 0.6320. Now here's the fascinating part, and it's really a cornerstone of his whole approach. Proactive risk management. Almost immediately after entering the trade, he carefully readjusted his stop loss down to 0.6307. By doing that, the trade instantly became risk-free. The worst that could happen was breaking even, minus maybe tiny commission slippage. And this shows something critical. Being able to make a trade risk-free is often more important than nailing the absolute perfect entry point. It shifts your focus from predicting the future perfectly to just managing your potential downside first. So this super disciplined approach, combined with that solid understanding of the trend direction coming from multiple confirming indicators, it resulted in a profit of $23. It's a perfect example of how small consistent wins can really add up over time, especially when you control risks so tightly, and prioritize protecting your capital above all else. And he really hammeres home the point. You should buy only on a dip and sell only on a rally, always, always trading with the main trend you've identified. Yeah, that's such a clear illustration. The goal isn't always trying to hit that one massive home run trade that everyone talks about. It's more about grinding out consistent controlled profits over time, precision and patience. Absolutely. This whole deep dive into the Sunil system really hammers home that successful trading. It isn't just about knowing what indicators are as much deeper. It's about understanding how they all interact, how they fit together within a bigger disciplined framework. It's about mixing that strategic insight from the charts with really solid risk management, turning all that abstract data into clear actionable trading decisions. And that seamless blend, that integration of the long-term view with the dynamic short-term trade management, that's what really gives you the power to navigate the market's complexities. And frankly, the emotional ups and downs, too. Yes, this great philosophy. Heads you win, tails you don't lose much. That really sums up the whole system's focus on risk first. Definitely. And for anyone listening who wants to truly master these ideas, getting to all the fine details, the specific rules of this unique system. While Sunil's book, a practical system for trading for an exchange, is just an invaluable resource. It goes into way more depth on every single indicator, the detailed, Elliott Wave counting methods, exactly how to set up that risk management dashboard step-by-step, and loads more trading examples that we just couldn't cover in detail today. So for you, the listener, the journey definitely continues. What's really fascinating here, I think, is just how much control you potentially can exert over your own trading results, even when markets seem totally chaotic. It really comes down to developing your own solid trading personality, as Sunil calls it. And that comes through continuous learning, discipline practice, and really committing to a system that's proven to work. So maybe a final question for you to think about as you reflect on all this. How will you combine strategy that essential discipline to patients and a deep, integrated understanding of the market to make your own trading journey both intellectually stimulating and hopefully financially rewarding?
